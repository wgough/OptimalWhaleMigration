# Summary

Long-distance animal migrations are energetically demanding behaviors performed for a variety of reasons, with migrants facing a continuum between cost- and time-minimizing strategies [@abrahms_etal19; @alerstam_lindstrom90; @block_etal11; @kenney_etal01; @lasorte_etal16; @merkle_etal16; @pitman_etal15]. Minimizing expenditure leaves more energy available for other processes (e.g., growth and reproduction), but may result in fewer foraging opportunities. Minimizing time results in longer foraging periods and increased energetic intake, but incurs high movement costs. Optimal migration theory predicts that migrants may optimize their energy budget by adopting an intermediate strategy [@alerstam_lindstrom90]. To test this hypothesis, we chose baleen whales (Mysticeti), a well-studied group of capital breeders (i.e., species which rely on accumulated energy stores from a discrete feeding season to fuel reproduction and maintenance throughout the year) that exhibit ocean-basin scale migrations, large body sizes, and relatively fast reproductive cycles that would presumably drive optimization of their annual energy budget [@drent_daan80; @evans_bearhop22; @horton_etal22; @jonsson97; @stephens_etal09; @fortune_etal12; @goldbogen_etal19; @johnson_etal22; @lockyer07]. Using tag-based estimates of foraging intake and swimming costs, we modeled the energy gained during a variable-duration foraging season and the energy spent during a variable-speed migration [@gough_etal22; @savoca_etal21]. We found optimal migration speeds of approximately 1 ms-1 for shorter migration distances, with longer migrations requiring higher speeds to minimize transit costs relative to foraging intake. Our model accurately predicted the migration distance and speed relationship for 67 satellite-tracked mysticetes from three species and 10 migration routes as well as low migration costs at optimal speeds (<15% of annual budget) in most cases. These results demonstrate that time- and energy-minimizing migration strategies are not distinct options, and migrants optimize their annual energy budgets by adopting intermediate strategies.

# Results

## Annual Energetic Cost of Migration

Recent studies on several mysticete species combining biologging tags with UAS-derived (unmanned aerial systems) morphometrics and hydrodynamic physical modeling have produced high-resolution estimates of energetic intake and costs for both foraging and swimming [@goldbogen_etal19; @savoca_etal21] (Figure 1). Using those estimates, we quantified the relationship between migration distance and the percentage of annual energetic budget devoted to migration (Figure 2). Of the four species in our analysis, cost per km of migration increased the fastest in humpback whales (increased by factor of 17.58 between 2000km and 12000km) and slowest in Antarctic minke whales (increased by factor of 17.04 between 2000km and 12000km).

![Figure 1. Schematic of a humpback whale annual cycle (right) with a generic equatorward migration route highlighted (bottom left). The upper left box highlights the variables used to determine the energetic cost and intake of a single day on the foraging ground.](./figs/AnnualCycleSchematic.png)

From satellite tracks of migrating humpback (n=24) and blue whales (n=41), we found the combined 95th percentile of migration distances to be 8956km, corresponding to annual migration costs ranging from 10-20%. Mean migration distances of 5511km for humpback and 4080km for blue whales correlated with lower annual migration costs (>10%). We did not have a full energetic model for the gray whales in our dataset (n=2), but their migration distances were long (>10000km), suggesting annual migration costs as high as 30%.

![Figure 2. Relationship between migration distance and the percentage of annual energy used for migration. Curves correspond to the minimal energy used for migration (annual total) as a percentage of annual net feeding season energy intake for an animal performing migrations of a given uni-directional distance. Probability density plots correspond to the migration distances for humpback (orange; n=24) and blue (blue; n=41) whales taken from our satellite tag dataset. The vertical dotted line denotes the 95th percentile for the probability densities combined (8956km).](./figs/MigrationPercentages.png)

## Optimal Migration Speeds

We found a concave relationship between the over-ground swimming speed of an individual and the ratio of net feeding season energy intake to migration energy loss (Figure 3). Each curve displays a single speed at which the energetic ratio of cost:benefit was minimized, representing an optimal migration speed. These optimal migration speeds fell between 0.95-1.55 m s-1 across our range of migration distances (2000-12000km), with longer migration distances correlated with faster optimal migration speeds and an increased ratio of migration costs to annual energy intake. Longer migration distances also correlated with a higher percentage of the annual cycle (in days) devoted to migration (ranging from 13% or 47.5 days for a 2000km migration to 48.3% or 176.4 days for a 12000km migration).

The average over-ground swimming speeds for blue whales (1.01 m s-1) taken from our satellite tag dataset aligned closely with our predicted optimal speed for a 4000km migration distance (1.050 m s-1), a distance very close to their average migration distance (4080km). Speeds for humpback whales (1.30 m s-1) were higher, aligning closely with the optimal speed for a 8000km migration (1.30 m s-1) while their average migration distance (5511km) would suggest a swimming speed closer to the optimal speed for our 6000km curve (1.175 m s-1). At distances near the middle of our range (~6000km), optimal migration speeds align closely with optimal cruising speeds (~2.5m s-1 swimming or ~1.25m s-1 over-ground) found during routine swimming [@gough_etal19; @gough_etal21].

We compared our modeled relationship between migration distance and swimming speed against our full satellite tag dataset (n=67) and found a similar increasing relationship between migration distance and over-ground swimming speed (Figure 4; p=0.99). Migration direction (equatorward vs. poleward) did not impact this relationship and did not differ for migration distance (p=0.68) or swimming speed (p=0.24). Across the range of migration distances, swimming speeds from our satellite tag dataset were significantly higher than our model by approximately 0.1 m s-1 (intercepts of 0.88 and 0.84; p<0.001).

# Discussion

Our results are the first to show that a group of long-distance migratory species optimize their travel speeds for energetic efficiency across a range of migration distances. These optimal migration speeds result from a tradeoff between phenological constraints and swimming costs. If whales swim slower than the optimal speed (cost-minimizing), then the late arrival to the foraging grounds reduces foraging opportunities and energy intake. Conversely, whales that swim faster than the optimal speed (time-minimizing) incur locomotor costs greater than the energy gained from additional feeding days. In keeping with optimal migration theory, our model predicted an intermediate solution for each migration distance that optimized the cost:benefit ratio between migration swimming costs and feeding season energy intake.

Previous research on migrating mysticetes found an energetic tradeoff within the migration route, with faster migrations incurring higher swimming costs but lower metabolic costs over a shorter period of time, leading to near-parity in energetic costs between short- and long-distance migrations [@riekkola_etal20]. Our results suggest that, even at optimal swimming speeds, longer migrations incur higher costs when we factor in the broader annual cycle (Figures 3-4). From this purely energetic standpoint, the optimal life-history strategy would be to reduce migration costs to zero and remain in one place throughout the year, suggesting that the fitness benefits of a migration must outweigh the energetic costs.

Fitness benefits can manifest in a number of documented ways, from predator and parasite avoidance to better mate selection or the maximization of energy intake at another location or point in the year [@avgar_etal14, p. 201; @braithwaite_etal15; @pelletier_etal20]. For species that track shifting food sources [@aikens_etal20], migration is an obvious tactic to increase energetic intake. For large mysticetes that leave their prey-rich foraging grounds in the winter, migration likely developed as a way to escape the high-latitude habitats of mammal-eating killer whales (Orcinus orca) and protect newborn calves from predation during their most vulnerable life stages [@corkeron_connor99; @mehta_etal07; @pitman_etal15]. This suggests that the fitness benefit from increased calf survival is greater than the costs of higher adult mortality.

Mysticetes are thought to have established long-distance migration patterns and experienced rapid gigantism in the last ~5-10 million years due to a phase shift in ocean ecosystems towards stronger seasonality [@taylor_etal19; @slater_etal17]. The high foraging efficiencies that resulted from this shift likely allowed for rapid mass-specific calf development and growth with subsequently shorter, less costly breeding season intervals [@oftedal97a; @fortune_etal12; @read_harvey89; @sibly_brown07]. Large body sizes also result in low mass-specific transport costs and large energy reserves, resulting in lower migration costs and an increased ability to support a capital breeding lifestyle [@oftedal00; @williams18].

This suite of evolutionary adaptations has allowed mysticetes to remain successful for the last ~5 million years, but this fast pace of life is dependent on abundant and predictable prey resources. Anthropogenic impacts on modern oceans (i.e. climate change, pollution, overfishing, ocean noise) have begun to impact the reliability and geographic location of prey species, possibly resulting in longer and more costly migrations [@hazen_etal13]. The majority of whales in our analysis migrated less than ~9000km (uni-directionally) in a year, thereby keeping energetics costs low (~5-15% of annual budget; Figure 2). But in the future situations outlined, an increase of 1000-2000km could have a substantial impact on the cost of migration - increasing it by as much as 5-10%. In addition, unexpected or cumulative disturbances can cause direct impacts on the foraging success of mysticetes [@pirotta_etal18; @pirotta_etal19], lowering their annual energy intake below the theoretical values that we have predicted. Villegas-Amtmann et al. [@villegas-amtmann_etal15; @villegas-amtmann_etal17] found that for the gray whale, a feeding season intake reduction of as little as 4% could result in a suspension of pregnancy, while a reduction of ~30% would represent a significant impact on long-term species fitness. These scenarios call into question whether life history strategies that include long-distance migrations will remain profitable into the future, or whether shorter distance or non-migratory strategies such as those seen in equatorial mysticete populations will become more common [@izadi_etal22; @iwata_etal17; @christiansen_etal; @geijer_etal16; @best01]. In any event, mysticetes' ability to optimize their travel speeds for energetic efficiency at different migratory distances undoubtedly increases their individual and species-level fitness.

# Materials & Methods

We chose a five-meter range of body lengths ($TL_{\text{body}}$) for four mysticete species: blue (_Balaenoptera musculus_), fin (_Balaenoptera physalus_), humpback (_Megaptera novaeangliae_), and Antarctic minke (_Balaenoptera bonaerensis_). Each range was centered at the average body length for that species taken from a UAS dataset of tagged animals used to calculate our swimming and feeding ground energetic estimates [@gough_etal21; @gough_etal22]. 

## Satellite Tag Data

In a literature review of satellite tag data for migratory mysticetes, we found data for blue (n = 41) and humpback (n = 24), with smaller numbers for the gray (_Eschrichtius robustus_; n = 2).

Satellite tag data was compiled from multiple literature sources and tag types (Table S1). To be included in our dataset, a satellite track had to include: 1) a complete migration moving in either direction (i.e., from foraging ground to breeding ground or vice-versa), 2) not include any portions of swimming on the foraging or breeding grounds, 3) the overall distance covered by the animal during the migration ($D_{\text{mig}}$; km), and 4) the duration of the migration period ($T_{\text{mig.uni}}$; days). Using this data, we were able to calculate the over-ground speed of each animal ($U_{\text{over-ground}}$; $m s^{-1}$) using the equation:

$$
U_{\text{over-ground}} = \frac{D_{\text{mig}}*1000}{T_{\text{mig.uni}}*86400} \quad (1)
$$

Using average values for $D_{\text{mig}}$, $T_{\text{mig.uni}}$, and $U_{\text{over-ground}}$, we calculated the distance ($D_{\text{mig.avg}}$), duration ($T_{\text{mig.uni.avg}}$), and over-ground speed ($U_{\text{over-ground.avg}}$) for a stereotypical migration route (Figure S1). We used these values to parameterize a standardized annual cycle as well as our energetic models.

## Standardized Annual Cycle

Our energetic models were predicated on a standardized annual cycle, with costs and benefits calculated as deviations from that cycle. From our satellite tag dataset, we calculated $T_{\text{mig.uni.avg}}$ to be 52 days (Figure S1), so we estimated 50 days for a uni-directional migration ($T_{\text{mig.uni.standard}}$), resulting in 100 days spent migrating during a standardized annual cycle ($T_{\text{mig.year.standard}}$). For the time spent on the breeding ground ($T_{\text{breed.standard}}$), we estimated 60 days based on sightings data, specifically from Maui-Nui for humpback whales (Evans et al., in prep; van Aswegen, pers. comm.). Finally, we estimated the feeding season as the remaining portion of the year, set to 205 days ($T_{\text{feed.standard}}$).

## Foraging Season Energetics

We determined the net energy obtained from a day of foraging ($Enet_{\text{feed.day}}$; kJ) using the equation:

$$
E_{\text{feed.day}} = E_{\text{feed.day.gain}} - E_{\text{feed.day.cost}} \quad (2)
$$

where $E_{\text{feed.day.gain}}$ and $E_{\text{feed.day.cost}}$ are calculated for each species at a given body length using body length regressions from the literature [@gough_etal22]. These regressions subtracted the energetic cost of a lunge feeding event from the energetic intake of that same event, then multiplied the duration of the lunge feeding event by the average number of lunges performed in a day for that species taken from Savoca et al. [-@savoca_etal21]. For the remaining portion of the day, we calculated the energetic cost per second using metabolic equations outlined by Gough et al. [-@gough_etal22] and body mass ($M_{\text{body}}$; kg) calculated from body length using methods outlined by Kahane-Rapport and Goldbogen [-@kahane-rapport_goldbogen18]. To determine the net energy flux for a standard feeding season ($E_{feed.year.standard}$; kJ), we multiplied $E_{\text{feed.day}}$ by the $T_{\text{feed.standard}}$ using the equation:

$$
E_{\text{feed.year.standard}} = E_{\text{feed.day}}*T_{\text{feed.standard}} \quad (3)
$$

## Migration Route Energetics

We estimated the combined energetic cost of swimming and metabolism ($E_{\text{swim.sec}}$; $kJs^{-1}$) for each species at a given body length using the equation:

$$
E_{\text{swim.sec}} = 
(\frac{P_{\text{T}}*M_{\text{body}}}{\eta_{\text{met}}*\eta_{\text{prop}}}+
\frac{BMR_{\text{kleiber}}*1000}{86400}) \div 1000 \quad (4)
$$

where $P_{\text{T}}$ is the thrust power output ($Wkg^{-1}$) estimated for a given swimming speed ($U_{swim}$; $ms^{-1}$) with a regression taken from Gough et al. [-@gough_etal21], $\eta_{\text{met}}$ is a metabolic efficiency factor set at 0.25 [@fish96; @fish_rohr99; @potvin_etal21], $\eta_{\text{prop}}$ is a propulsive efficiency factor set at 0.90 [@gough_etal21], $BMR_{\text{kleiber}}$ is the basal metabolic rate using a Kleiber function ($70*{M_{\text{body}}}^{075}$) [@kleiber75]. To determine the energetic cost of a single migration day ($E_{\text{mig-day}}$; kJ), we multiplied the per-second value of $E_{\text{swim.sec}}$ by the percentage of time spent actively fluking for each species ($\%_{\text{fluke}}$) and the number of seconds in a day:

$$
E_{\text{mig.day}} = (E_{\text{swim.sec}}*\%_{\text{fluke}}*86400) + ({BMR_{\text{kleiber}}}*(1-\%_{\text{fluke}})) \quad (5)
$$

and included the metabolic cost for the remaining portion of the day. We estimated $\%_{\text{fluke}}$ for each species using previously published tag data from the four species included in our analyses [@gough_etal22]. These estimations resulted in 35% for the blue whale, 40% for the fin whale, 55% for the humpback whale, and 65% for the Antarctic minke whale. Finally, we could calculate the overall cost of a migration ($E_{\text{mig.year.standard}}$) using the equation:

$$
E_{\text{mig.year.standard}} = E_{\text{mig.day}}*T_{\text{mig.year.standard}} \quad (6)
$$

## Speed-Adjusted Energetics

We used previously published data from 2 migrating blue whales [@oestreich_etal20] to compare straight-line migration speed to both $U_{\text{over-ground}}$ and $U_{\text{swim}}$. These measurements resulted in a multiplicative factor of 2.0 to convert values of $U_{\text{over-ground}}$ from our satellite tag dataset into $U_{\text{swim}}$ values that could be used to more accurately calculate $E_{\text{swim-sec}}$. This factor also allowed us to create a range of speeds for both $U_{\text{over-ground}}$ and $U_{\text{swim}}$ to calculate changes in annual energy flux.

For a given $U_{\text{over-ground}}$ value, we could calculate an adjusted value for the duration of a uni-directional migration period ($T_{\text{mig.uni.adj}}$) using the equation:

$$
T_{\text{mig.uni.adj}}=\frac{D_{\text{mig}}*1000*86400}{U_{\text{over-ground}}} \quad (7)
$$

with the overall days spent migrating during an annual cycle ($T_{\text{mig.year.adj}}$) given given as:

$$
T_{\text{mig.year.adj}}= T_{\text{mig.uni.adj}}*2 \quad (8)
$$

We could then update the uni-directional cost of migration ($E_{\text{mig.uni.adj}}$) using the equation:

$$
E_{\text{mig.uni.adj}} = E_{\text{mig.day}}*T_{\text{mig.uni.adj}} \quad (9)
$$

with the annual cost of migration given as:

$$
E_{\text{mig.year.adj}} = E_{\text{mig.uni.adj}}*2 \quad (10)
$$

We then used our $T_{\text{mig.year.adj}}$ values across our range of $U_{\text{over-ground}}$ to calculate the change in feeding season duration from $T_{\text{mig.year.standard}}$ due to migration speed ($\Delta T_{\text{feed}}$) using the equation:

$$
\Delta T_{\text{feed.year}} = T_{\text{mig.year.adj}}-T_{\text{mig.year.standard}} \quad (11)
$$

and the subsequent change in net energy intake per year ($\Delta E_{\text{feed.year}}$) using the following equations:

$$
\Delta E_{\text{feed.year}} = E_{\text{feed-day}}*\Delta T_{\text{feed.year}} \quad (12)
$$

Next, we recalculated the net energy from the foraging season ($E_{\text{feed.year.adj}}$) using the equation:

$$
E_{\text{feed.year.adj}} = E_{\text{feed.year.standard}} - \Delta E_{\text{feed.year}} \quad (13)
$$

We then calculated the ratio of between $E_{\text{mig.year.adj}}$ and $E_{\text{feed.year.adj}}$ ($E_{ratio}$) using the following equation:

$$
E_{\text{ratio}} = \frac{E_{\text{mig.year.adj}}}{E_{\text{feed.year.adj}}} \quad (14)
$$

Finally, we could calculate the speed values (both $U_{\text{swim}}$ and $U_{\text{over-ground}}$) at which $E_{\text{ratio}}$ is minimized ($U_{opt}$) using the following equation:

$$
U_{\text{opt}} = min(E_{\text{ratio}}) \quad (15)
$$

We repeated these analyses for a range of $D_{\text{mig}}$ values from 2000-12000km, informed by the range of migration distances found in our review of satellite tracks in the literature. For each value of $D_{\text{mig}}$ in this range, we could calculate the minimum value of $E_{\text{mig.year.adj}}$ as a percentage of $E_{\text{feed.year.adj}}$. A schematic of our workflow is given in Figure S2.

![Figure S2. Simplified schematic showing the progression from external data sources to our optimal migratory speed calculations. Satellite tag data was sourced from the literature and is detailed in Table S1, while multi-sensor tag data and morphometrics were obtained from Gough et al. (-@gough_etal22). Together, these data were used to calculate the foraging and migration energetics for a generalized annual cycle (50 days on each migration route, 60 days on the breeding ground, 205 days on the feeding ground). We recalculated these energetics at each over-ground swimming speed between 0.5-2.0m s-1 for each uni-directional migration distance between 2000-12000km. From these speed-adjusted models, we could determine which over-ground swimming speed produced the optimal value of $E_{\text{ratio}}$ at each uni-directional migration distance.](./figs/Methods/EquationSchematic.jpg)
