  {"id":"abrahms_etal19","abstract":"Significance\n            The causes and consequences of animal migration have received substantial research attention, yet the mechanisms underlying this global phenomenon remain largely untested in marine systems. By combining 10 years of satellite tracking data on blue whales with simultaneous remotely-sensed oceanographic measurements in the North Pacific, we demonstrate that both long-term memory and resource tracking play key roles in the long-distance migrations of marine megafauna. These findings have important implications for long-lived species across systems and taxa, as long-range migrants conditioned by historical environmental processes may struggle in response to rapid environmental change. Finally, our study reveals that ecological theory of animal migrations is conserved across marine and terrestrial systems.\n          , \n            In terrestrial systems, the green wave hypothesis posits that migrating animals can enhance foraging opportunities by tracking phenological variation in high-quality forage across space (i.e., “resource waves”). To track resource waves, animals may rely on proximate cues and/or memory of long-term average phenologies. Although there is growing evidence of resource tracking in terrestrial migrants, such drivers remain unevaluated in migratory marine megafauna. Here we present a test of the green wave hypothesis in a marine system. We compare 10 years of blue whale movement data with the timing of the spring phytoplankton bloom resulting in increased prey availability in the California Current Ecosystem, allowing us to investigate resource tracking both contemporaneously (response to proximate cues) and based on climatological conditions (memory) during migrations. Blue whales closely tracked the long-term average phenology of the spring bloom, but did not track contemporaneous green-up. In addition, blue whale foraging locations were characterized by low long-term habitat variability and high long-term productivity compared with contemporaneous measurements. Results indicate that memory of long-term average conditions may have a previously underappreciated role in driving migratory movements of long-lived species in marine systems, and suggest that these animals may struggle to respond to rapid deviations from historical mean environmental conditions. Results further highlight that an ecological theory of migration is conserved across marine and terrestrial systems. Understanding the drivers of animal migration is critical for assessing how environmental changes will affect highly mobile fauna at a global scale.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Abrahms","given":"Briana"},{"family":"Hazen","given":"Elliott L."},{"family":"Aikens","given":"Ellen O."},{"family":"Savoca","given":"Matthew S."},{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Jeremy A."},{"family":"Bograd","given":"Steven J."},{"family":"Jacox","given":"Michael G."},{"family":"Irvine","given":"Ladd M."},{"family":"Palacios","given":"Daniel M."},{"family":"Mate","given":"Bruce R."}],"citation-key":"abrahms_etal19","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"acevedo_etal22","abstract":"Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) seasonally migrate between their corresponding breeding and feeding grounds; however, some individual whales deviate from this pattern migrating to different breeding or feeding grounds. Here, we report the first recorded movement of a humpback whale between the Antarctic Peninsula and the east coast of Australia. The individual whale, a known female, was identified by natural markings in the Antarctic Peninsula feeding area, and then photographed 15 years later in Byron Bay, on the eastern coast of Australia. This constitutes the longest migration for any humpback whale documented to date in the South Pacific Ocean and in the Southern Hemisphere (143° of longitude). Although the route is uncertain and the cues may be environmental, social or demographic, or some combinations thereof, this exceptional movement between two distant Breeding Stocks in the South Pacific Ocean demonstrates that longitudinal long-distance migrations among humpback whale populations do take place, at least occasionally, and perhaps may not be as atypical as it has been thought.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Acevedo","given":"Jorge"},{"family":"Aguayo-Lobo","given":"Anelio"},{"family":"Beeman","given":"Peta"},{"family":"Cheeseman","given":"Ted"},{"family":"Olavarría","given":"Carlos"}],"citation-key":"acevedo_etal22","container-title":"Mammalian Biology","container-title-short":"Mamm Biol","DOI":"10.1007/s42991-021-00195-2","ISSN":"1618-1476","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"language":"en","source":"Springer Link","title":"From the Antarctic Peninsula to eastern Australia: the longest migration of a humpback whale through the South Pacific Ocean","title-short":"From the Antarctic Peninsula to eastern Australia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s42991-021-00195-2"},

Here, we test the hypothesis that the foraging behavior of\nthese two species (lunge-feeding) is energetically expensive and limits their\ndive duration. We estimated the cost of lunge-feeding in both species using an\napproach that combined attaching time/depth recorders to seven blue whales and\neight fin whales and comparing the collected dive information with predictions\nmade by optimality models of dive behavior. We show that the rate at which\nwhales recovered from a foraging dive was twice that of a non-foraging dive\nand that the cost of foraging relative to the cost of travel to and from the\nprey patch was 3.15 in blue whales (95 % CI 2.58-3.72) and 3.60 in fin whales\n(95 % CI 2.35-4.85). Whales foraged in small areas (<1 km2) and\nforaging bouts lasted more than one dive, indicating that prey did not\ndisperse and thus that prey dispersal could not account for the limited dive\ndurations of the whales. Despite the enormous size of blue whales and fin\nwhales, the high energetic costs of lunge-feeding confine them to short\ndurations of submergence and to areas with dense prey aggregations. As a\ncorollary, because of their limited foraging time under water, these whales\nmay be particularly vulnerable to perturbations in prey abundance.","author":[{"family":"Acevedo-Gutiérrez","given":"Alejandro"},{"family":"Croll","given":"Donald A."},{"family":"Tershy","given":"Bernie R."}],"citation-key":"acevedo-gutierrez_etal02","container-title":"The Journal of Experimental Biology","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,6,15]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2128692892","page":"1747-1753","PMID":"12042333","title":"High feeding costs limit dive time in the largest whales.","type":"article-journal","volume":"205"},
  {"id":"achmadsahri_etal22","abstract":"Marine migratory species tend to be overlooked in marine spatial planning due to limited knowledge of their habitats and migration pathways, resulting in a disconnect between animal migration ecology and spatial management decision making. The aim of this study was to predict the migratory corridors, suitable habitats and use of marine reserves by pygmy blue whales and overlap with marine traffic. Firstly, based on available telemetry data, we analysed the home ranges, core-use areas and migratory corridors using Brownian Bridge Movement Models. Secondly, we predicted suitable habitat by modelling telemetry data against environmental predictors using Maximum Entropy modelling; and lastly we geometrically overlaid home ranges and suitable habitats with designated migration lanes, marine protected areas and marine traffic. Consistent movement of pygmy blue whales from Western Australia to the Banda and Molucca Seas in Indonesia demonstrated a high level of connectivity between the two regions. There is a discrepancy between the designated migration lanes for large whales in Indonesian marine spatial planning and migration routes suggested by this study. The home range analysis and habitat models revealed that large areas of the migration corridors, core-use, and suitable habitats are currently not protected, particularly along international waters and within the Banda and Molucca Seas. The results can aid marine conservation planning by delineating the important areas and areas with high marine traffic density to optimise migratory species protection. • Consistent pygmy blue whale's movements have shown a high degree of Indo-Australia connectivity. • There was a spatial mismatch between areas important for pygmy blue whale and marine protected areas. • There is discrepancy between migration lanes for large whales in Indonesia and migration routes yielded from our study. • Areas important for pygmy blue whale overlap with some busiest shipping routes in the region. • Transboundary management is needed to protect areas important for pygmy blue whale.","author":[{"literal":"Achmad Sahri"},{"literal":"Charlotte Jak"},{"literal":"Mochamad Iqbal Herwata Putra"},{"literal":"Albertinka J.

  {"id":"adams_fish19","abstract":"Dorso-ventral oscillations of cetacean caudal flukes generate lift-based thrust for swimming. Movements of the flukes are actuated by epaxial and hypaxial muscles through caudal tendons inserting onto vertebrate in the peduncle. To determine if the caudal tendons in the peduncle affect the flexibility of the flukes, we must understand how the tendons from axial muscles insert onto the caudal vertebrate. The purpose of this study was to provide a detailed description of the various tendons within the cetacean peduncle with regard to their role in swimming and flexibility. Dissection of the peduncle and flukes of multiple odontocete species showed that there were two distinct epaxial tendon sets within the peduncle: (1) extensor caudae medialis tendon (ECM) and (2) extensor caudae lateralis tendon (ECL). There is one distinct hypaxial tendon set, the medial tendon of the hypaxialis lumborum (MHL). The ECM and MHL tendons inserted serially onto caudal vertebrae while the ECL inserted exclusively onto the terminal vertebrae posterior to the fluke insertion. It is typical that tendons insert onto bone, however, the connection to the core fibrous layer of the flukes suggests an element of active control of the flexibility of the flukes via the axial muscles. Tension from muscular contraction transmitted through the tendons could affect both spanwise and chordwise flexibility. Changing flexibility could modulate thrust and efficiency over an extended operation range of swimming speeds in cetaceans.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Adams","given":"Danielle S."},{"family":"Fish","given":"Frank E."}],"citation-key":"adams_fish19","container-title":"Journal of Morphology","DOI":"10.1002/jmor.21033","ISSN":"03622525","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"1323-1331","source":"Crossref","title":"Odontocete peduncle tendons for possible control of fluke orientation and flexibility","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/jmor.21033","volume":"280"},

Nonetheless, empirical support for the Green Wave Hypothesis is mixed, and a framework for understanding variation in surfing is lacking.

Green-wave surfing varied among individuals and was unrelated to age or energetic state. Instead, the greenscape, which we define as the order, rate and duration of green-up along migratory routes, was the primary factor influencing surfing.

  {"id":"aikens_etal20","abstract":"Animals exhibit a diversity of movement tactics [1]. Tracking resources that change across space and time is predicted to be a fundamental driver of animal movement [2]. For example, some migratory ungulates (i.e., hooved mammals) closely track the progression of highly nutritious plant green-up, a phenomenon called “green-wave surfing” [3, 4, 5]. Yet general principles describing how the dynamic nature of resources determine movement tactics are lacking [6]. We tested an emerging theory that predicts surfing and the existence of migratory behavior will be favored in environments where green-up is fleeting and moves sequentially across large landscapes (i.e., wave-like green-up) [7]. Landscapes exhibiting wave-like patterns of green-up facilitated surfing and explained the existence of migratory behavior across 61 populations of four ungulate species on two continents (n = 1,696 individuals). At the species level, foraging benefits were equivalent between tactics, suggesting that each movement tactic is fine-tuned to local patterns of plant phenology. For decades, ecologists have sought to understand how animals move to select habitat, commonly defining habitat as a set of static patches [8, 9]. Our findings indicate that animal movement tactics emerge as a function of the flux of resources across space and time, underscoring the need to redefine habitat to include its dynamic attributes. As global habitats continue to be modified by anthropogenic disturbance and climate change [10], our synthesis provides a generalizable framework to understand how animal movement will be influenced by altered patterns of resource phenology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Aikens","given":"Ellen O."},{"family":"Mysterud","given":"Atle"},{"family":"Merkle","given":"Jerod A."},{"family":"Cagnacci","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Rivrud","given":"Inger Maren"},{"family":"Hebblewhite","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Hurley","given":"Mark A."},{"family":"Peters","given":"Wibke"},{"family":"Bergen","given":"Scott"},{"family":"De Groeve","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Dwinnell","given":"Samantha P.

  {"id":"alexander05","abstract":"To achieve the required generality, models designed to predict scaling relationships for diverse groups of animals generally need to be simple. An argument based on considerations of dynamic similarity predicts correctly that the mechanical cost of transport for running [power/(body mass × speed)]will be independent of body mass; but measurements of oxygen consumption for running birds and mammals show that the metabolic cost of transport is proportional to (body mass)-0.32. Thus the leg muscles seem to work more efficiently in larger animals. A model that treats birds as fixed wing aircraft predicts that the mechanical power required for flight at the maximum range speed will be proportional to (body mass)1.02, but the metabolic power is found to be proportional to (body mass)0.83;again, larger animals seem to have more efficient muscles. A model that treats hovering hummingbirds and insects as helicopters predicts mechanical power to be approximately proportional to body mass, but measurements of oxygen consumption once again show efficiency increasing with body mass. A model of swimming fish as rigid submarines predicts power to be proportional to (body mass)0.5×(speed)2.5 or to (body mass)0.6×(speed)2.8, depending on whether flow in the boundary layer is laminar or turbulent. Unfortunately, this prediction cannot easily be compared with available compilations of metabolic data. The finding that efficiency seems to increase with body mass, at least in running and flight, is discussed in relation to the metabolic energy costs of muscular work and force.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Alexander","given":"R.

  {"id":"allen_etal16","abstract":"The introduction of animal-borne, multisensor tags has opened up many opportunities for ecological research, making previously inaccessible species and behaviors observable. The advancement of tag technology and the increasingly widespread use of bio-logging tags are leading to large volumes of sometimes extremely detailed data. With the increasing quantity and duration of tag deployments, a set of tools needs to be developed to aid in facilitating and standardizing the analysis of movement sensor data. Here, we developed an observation-based decision tree method to detect feeding events in data from multisensor movement tags attached to fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus). Fin whales exhibit an energetically costly and kinematically complex foraging behavior called lunge feeding, an intermittent ram filtration mechanism. Using this automated system, we identified feeding lunges in 19 fin whales tagged with multisensor tags, during a total of over 100h of continuously sampled data. Using movement sensor and hydrophone data, the automated lunge detector correctly identified an average of 92.8% of all lunges, with a false-positive rate of 9.5%. The strong performance of our automated feeding detector demonstrates an effective, straightforward method of activity identification in animal-borne movement tag data. Our method employs a detection algorithm that utilizes a hierarchy of simple thresholds based on knowledge of observed features of feeding behavior, a technique that is readily modifiable to fit a variety of species and behaviors. Using automated methods to detect behavioral events in tag records will significantly decrease data analysis time and aid in standardizing analysis methods, crucial objectives with the rapidly increasing quantity and variety of on-animal tag data. Furthermore, our results have implications for next-generation tag design, especially long-term tags that can be outfitted with on-board processing algorithms that automatically detect kinematic events and transmit ethograms via acoustic or satellite telemetry.","author":[{"family":"Allen","given":"Ann N."},{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Jeremy A."},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari S."},{"family":"Calambokidis","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"allen_etal16","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.2386","issue":"20","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2526292112","page":"7522-7535","PMID":"28725418","title":"Development of an automated method of detecting stereotyped feeding events in multisensor data from tagged rorqual whales.","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"allen_etal18","abstract":"Across scientific disciplines, there is a rapidly growing recognition of the need for more statistically robust, transparent approaches to data visualization. Complimentary to this, many scientists have realized the need for plotting tools that accurately and transparently convey key aspects of statistical effects and raw data with minimal distortion. Previously common approaches, such as plotting conditional mean or median barplots together with error-bars have been criticized for distorting effect size, hiding underlying patterns in the raw data, and obscuring the assumptions upon which the most commonly used statistical tests are based. Here we describe a data visualization approach which overcomes these issues, providing maximal statistical information while preserving the desired ‘inference at a glance’ nature of barplots and other similar visualization devices. These “raincloud plots” can visualize raw data, probability density, and key summary statistics such as median, mean, and relevant confidence intervals in an appealing and flexible format with minimal redundancy. In this tutorial paper we provide basic demonstrations of the strength of raincloud plots and similar approaches, outline potential modifications for their optimal use, and provide open-source code for their streamlined implementation in R, Python and Matlab (https://github.com/RainCloudPlots/RainCloudPlots).

  {"id":"allen_etal22","abstract":"Estimates of the energetic costs of locomotion (COL) at different activity levels are necessary to answer fundamental eco-physiological questions and to understand the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance to marine mammals. We combined estimates of energetic costs derived from breath-by-breath respirometry with measurements of overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) from biologging tags to validate ODBA as a proxy for COL in trained common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). We measured resting metabolic rate (RMR); mean individual RMR was 0.71–1.42 times that of a similarly sized terrestrial mammal and agreed with past measurements that used breath-by-breath and flow-through respirometry. We also measured energy expenditure during submerged swim trials, at primarily moderate exercise levels. We subtracted RMR to obtain COL, and normalized COL by body size to incorporate individual swimming efficiencies. We found both mass-specific energy expenditure and mass-specific COL were linearly related with ODBA. Measurements of activity level and cost of transport (the energy required to move a given distance) improve understanding of the COL in marine mammals. The strength of the correlation between ODBA and COL varied among individuals, but the overall relationship can be used at a broad scale to estimate the energetic costs of disturbance and daily locomotion costs to build energy budgets, and investigate the costs of diving in free-ranging animals where bio-logging data are available. We propose that a similar approach could be applied to other cetacean species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Allen","given":"Austin S."},{"family":"Read","given":"Andrew J."},{"family":"Shorter","given":"K.

  {"id":"amano_yoshioka03","abstract":"The diving behavior of a medium-sized female sperm whale off the Kumano Coast, Japan, was studied using a suction-cup-attached TDR (time depth recorder) tag. The tag remained attached to the whale for 62 h and recorded 74 dives deeper than 100 m. The whale repeatedly dived for 30 to 45 min down to 400–1200 m. Surface intervals were generally 10 min between dives, except for a period of 1.3 to 4.2 h spent at the surface every afternoon. The whale spent long periods of time at the bottom of dives, during which there was considerable variability in both depth and velocity data, with occasional bursts in velocity. These data suggest that sperm whales use an active search-and-pursue strategy while foraging. Assuming all dives with active bottom time were for foraging, this whale spent about 80% of its total time in foraging dives. Dives with little activity at depth were occasionally observed, which were probably for resting. Although dive parameters resemble those of northern bottlenose whales, dive profiles seem to be different, suggesting that these 2 deep diving cetaceans employ different foraging strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Amano","given":"M"},{"family":"Yoshioka","given":"M"}],"citation-key":"amano_yoshioka03","container-title":"Marine Ecology Progress Series","DOI":"10.3354/meps258291","ISSN":"0171-8630, 1616-1599","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"language":"en","page":"291-295","source":"Crossref","title":"Sperm whale diving behavior monitored using a suction-cup-attached TDR tag","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v258/p291-295/","volume":"258"},

  {"id":"anderwald_etal12","abstract":"Because pelagic prey concentrations are patchy in both space and time, predators such as marine mammals require high degrees of flexibility in their habitat use. We tested the hypothesis that minke whales Balaenoptera acutorostrata adjust their habitat use during the feeding season at different spatial scales: their overall distribution should be determined by broadscale oceanographic features, while foraging activity at finer scales should be dictated by shortterm changes in habitat conditions. Results from generalized additive models indicate that minke whale distribution off the west coast of Scotland is dependent largely on temporally variable parameters (sea surface temperature in spring, chlorophyll concentration in autumn), in addition to depth and topography. However, fine-scale foraging behaviour was dictated by the strength and direction of tidal currents. Seasonal distribution patterns according to environmental parameters were largely consistent between 2 different spatial scales, and over a time period of 15 yr. Significantly higher sighting rates occurred in areas of predicted sandeel Ammodytes marinus presence in spring, but not during the rest of the summer, while in August and September, prey samples from the core study area consisted almost entirely of sprat Sprattus sprattus. The low energetic cost of swimming in minke whales and their ability to switch between different prey according to their seasonal availability thus appears to allow them to readily respond to temporal changes in pelagic prey concentrations at different scales. This occurs through a distribution influenced by temporally variable parameters (temperature and chlorophyll concentration), combined with adjustments in foraging activity dependent on variable conditions at fine spatial scales (tides).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Anderwald","given":"P"},{"family":"Evans","given":"Pgh"},{"family":"Dyer","given":"R"},{"family":"Dale","given":"A"},{"family":"Wright","given":"Pj"},{"family":"Hoelzel","given":"Ar"}],"citation-key":"anderwald_etal12","container-title":"Marine Ecology Progress Series","container-title-short":"Mar.

  {"id":"andrews_enstipp16","abstract":"Abstract   To fully understand how diving seabirds and marine mammals balance the potentially conflicting demands of holding their breath while living their lives underwater (and maintaining physiological homeostasis during exercise, feeding, growth, and reproduction), physiological studies must be conducted with animals in their natural environments. The purpose of this article is to review the importance of making physiological measurements on diving animals in field settings, while acknowledging the challenges and highlighting some solutions. The most extreme divers are great candidates for study, especially in a comparative and mechanistic context. However, physiological data are also required of a wide range of species for problems relating to other disciplines, in particular ecology and conservation biology. Physiological data help with understanding and predicting the outcomes of environmental change, and the direct impacts of anthropogenic activities. Methodological approaches that have facilitated the development of field-based diving physiology include the isolated diving hole protocol and the translocation paradigm, and while there are many techniques for remote observation, animal-borne biotelemetry, or “biologging”, has been critical. We discuss issues related to the attachment of instruments, the retrieval of data and sensing of physiological variables, while also considering negative impacts of tagging. This is illustrated with examples from a variety of species, and an in-depth look at one of the best studied and most extreme divers, the emperor penguin ( Aptenodytes forsteri ).

However, with advances in satellite tagging technology and concurrent development of analytical methodologies we can now detail finer scale humpback whale movement, infer behavioural context and examine how these animals interact with their physical environment. Here we describe the temporal and spatial characteristics of migration along the east Australian seaboard and into the Southern Ocean by 30 humpback whales satellite tagged over three consecutive austral summers.

We demonstrate that Antarctic foraging habitat is associated with the marginal ice zone, with key predictors of inferred foraging behaviour including distance from the ice edge, ice melt rate and variability in ice concentration two months prior to arrival.

  {"id":"aoki_etal12","abstract":"Active hunting pursuit can involve high expenditures of energy and therefore requires appropriately high-energy gains from successful prey capture. Using data loggers deployed on 12 sperm whales off the Ogasawara Islands, we regularly recorded bursts of speed during deep dives. Here, we analyzed speed, acceleration, and 3D data from these maneuvers to describe the whales’ hunting behavior. Bursts occurred at depths >400 m. The median number of bursts was only 1 per dive (range: 0 to 6 per dive), and 33% of the dives did not include any bursts, suggesting prey capture may not always require bursts. Bursts of speed averaged 3.4 ± 1.0 m s–1 (mean ± SD; maximum: 8 m s–1), more than twice the mean speed observed during dives (1.5 ± 0.2 m s–1). Bursts were generally divided into two phases: (1) rapid acceleration with active stroking, and (2) drastic deceleration and changes in body orientation. Tagged whales swam up to 405 m (mean: 120 ± 88 m) during these two phases. Such behavior suggests chasing of their prey, and should incur high energy expenditure. A large percentage (20 ± 14%) of the drag-related locomotion cost of the dives was spent in bursts. Two major types of bursts were observed: inflectional bursts with turning (87%) and linear bursts without turning (13%). Our results strongly indicate that sperm whales use an active-pursuit hunting strategy and use the bursts only to catch powerful and nutritious prey (i.e. large and/or muscular) that compensate for the energetic cost of the burst.","author":[{"family":"Aoki","given":"Kagari"},{"family":"Amano","given":"Masao"},{"family":"Mori","given":"Kyoichi"},{"family":"Kourogi","given":"Aya"},{"family":"Kubodera","given":"Tsunemi"},{"family":"Miyazaki","given":"Nobuyuki"}],"citation-key":"aoki_etal12","container-title":"Marine Ecology Progress Series","DOI":"10.3354/meps09371","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,1,10]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2329318702","page":"289-301","title":"Active hunting by deep-diving sperm whales: 3D dive profiles and maneuvers during bursts of speed","type":"article-journal","volume":"444"},
  {"id":"aoki_etal17","abstract":"To maximize foraging duration at depth, diving mammals are expected to use the lowest cost optimal speed during descent and ascent transit and to minimize the cost of transport by achieving neutral buoyancy. Here, we outfitted 18 deep-diving long-finned pilot whales with multi-sensor data loggers and found indications that their diving strategy is associated with higher costs than those of other deep-diving toothed whales. Theoretical models predict that optimal speed is proportional to (basal metabolic rate/drag)1/3 and therefore to body mass0.05. The transit speed of tagged animals (2.7±0.3 m s−1) was substantially higher than the optimal speed predicted from body mass (1.4–1.7 m s−1). According to the theoretical models, this choice of high transit speed, given a similar drag coefficient (median, 0.0035) to that in other cetaceans, indicated greater basal metabolic costs during diving than for other cetaceans. This could explain the comparatively short duration (8.9±1.5 min) of their deep dives (maximum depth, 444±85 m). Hydrodynamic gliding models indicated negative buoyancy of tissue body density (1038.8± 1.6 kg m–3, ±95% credible interval, CI) and similar diving gas volume (34.6±0.6 ml kg−1, ±95% CI) to those in other deep-diving toothed whales. High diving metabolic rate and costly negative buoyancy imply a ‘spend more, gain more’ strategy of long-finned pilot whales, differing from that in other deep-diving toothed whales, which limits the costs of locomotion during foraging. We also found that net buoyancy affected the optimal speed: high transit speeds gradually decreased during ascent as the whales approached neutral buoyancy owing to gas expansion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Aoki","given":"Kagari"},{"family":"Sato","given":"Katsufumi"},{"family":"Isojunno","given":"Saana"},{"family":"Narazaki","given":"Tomoko"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Patrick J.

We cross-validated two independent approaches to estimate the body condition of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) at two feeding grounds in Canada and Norway: animal-borne tags (n = 59) and aerial photogrammetry (n = 55). Whales that had a large length-standardized projected area in overhead images (i.e. whales looked fatter) had lower estimated tissue body density (TBD) (greater lipid stores) from tag data. Linking both measurements in a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the true underlying (hidden) tissue body density (uTBD), we found uTBD was lower (−3.5 kg m−3) in pregnant females compared to adult males and resting females, while in lactating females it was higher (+6.0 kg m−3). Whales were more negatively buoyant (+5.0 kg m−3) in Norway than Canada during the early feeding season, possibly owing to a longer migration from breeding areas. While uTBD decreased over the feeding season across life-history traits, whale tissues remained negatively buoyant (1035.3 ± 3.8 kg m−3) in the late feeding season. This study adds confidence to the effectiveness of these independent methods to estimate the body condition of free-ranging whales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Aoki","given":"Kagari"},{"family":"Isojunno","given":"Saana"},{"family":"Bellot","given":"Charlotte"},{"family":"Iwata","given":"Takashi"},{"family":"Kershaw","given":"Joanna"},{"family":"Akiyama","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Martín López","given":"Lucía M."},{"family":"Ramp","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Biuw","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Swift","given":"René"},{"family":"Wensveen","given":"Paul J."},{"family":"Pomeroy","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Narazaki","given":"Tomoko"},{"family":"Hall","given":"Ailsa"},{"family":"Sato","given":"Katsufumi"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Patrick J.

  {"id":"arranz_etal19","abstract":"Air-breathing marine predators must balance the conflicting demands of oxygen conservation during breath-hold and the cost of diving and locomotion to capture prey. However, it remains poorly understood how predators modulate foraging performance when feeding at different depths and in response to changes in prey distribution and type. Here, we used high-resolution multi-sensor tags attached to Risso’s dolphins (Grampus griseus) and concurrent prey surveys to quantify their foraging performance over a range of depths and prey types. Dolphins (N=33) foraged in shallow and deep habitats [seabed depths less or more than 560m, respectively] and within the deep habitat, in vertically stratified prey features occurring at several aggregation levels. Generalized linear mixed-effects models indicated that dive kinematics were driven by foraging depth rather than habitat. Bottom-phase duration and number of buzzes (attempts to capture prey) per dive increased with depth. In deep dives, dolphins were gliding for >50% of descent and adopted higher pitch angles both during descent and ascents, which was likely to reduce energetic cost of longer transits. This lower cost of transit was counteracted by the record of highest vertical swim speeds, rolling maneuvers and stroke rates at depth, together with a 4-fold increase in the inter-buzz interval, suggesting higher costs of pursuing and handling prey compared to shallow-water feeding. In spite of the increased capture effort at depth, dolphins managed to keep their estimated overall metabolic rate comparable across dive types. This indicates that adjustments in swimming modes may enable energy balance in deeper dives. If we think of the surface as a central place where divers return to breathe, our data match predictions that central place foragers should increase the number and likely quality of prey items at greater distances. These dolphins forage efficiently from near-shore benthic communities to depth-stratified scattering layers, enabling them to maximize their fitness.","author":[{"family":"Arranz","given":"Patricia"},{"literal":"Kelly J.

Here we review several alternate hypotheses for the evolution of migration in mammals based on improvements in energetic gain and mate-finding contrasted with reduction in energetic costs or the risk of predation and parasitism. While there are well-documented examples of each across the order Mammalia, the available evidence to date most strongly supports the energy gain and predation risk hypotheses in the terrestrial realm, whereas a combined strategy of reducing energetic costs in one season but improving energetic gain in another season seems to characterize aquatic mammal species, as well as bats.

  {"id":"bailey_etal09","abstract":"Baleen whale migrations typically consist of annual movements between productive, high-latitude feeding grounds and unproductive, low-latitude breeding grounds. However, the actual migratory path and whales’ behaviour in these locations are poorly known. The objectives of this study were to apply a switching state-space model to the satellite tracks of blue whales Balaenoptera musculus in the Northeast Pacific to improve location estimation and gain insight into the migratory (transiting) and foraging (area-restricted search, ARS) behaviours of this population. During the period 1993 to 2007, Argos satellite tags were attached to 159 whales, mainly off the coast of California during late summer, of which 92 tracks were >7 d in duration. There was generally a southward movement during the winter to Baja California and to an area west of the Costa Rica Dome, in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP). Travel speeds during transit were significantly faster than during ARS movements (mean = 3.70 and 1.05 km h–1, respectively). On average, 29% of the track time was spent in ARS, and the mean time within an ARS patch was 21 d. The occurrence of ARS behaviour throughout the migration cycle suggests that these animals may forage year-round, but could also indicate limited movements during the reproductive season. The extent of their northward migration from Baja California to Washington varied significantly interannually, likely in response to environmental changes affecting their prey. The long track durations obtained from electronic tagging have provided essential new information about the critical habitats of Northeast Pacific blue whales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Bailey","given":"Helen"},{"family":"Mate","given":"Bruce R."},{"family":"Palacios","given":"Daniel M."},{"family":"Irvine","given":"Ladd"},{"family":"Bograd","given":"Steven J."},{"family":"Costa","given":"Daniel P."}],"citation-key":"bailey_etal09","container-title":"Endangered Species Research","DOI":"10.3354/esr00239","ISSN":"1863-5407, 1613-4796","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"en","page":"93-106","source":"www.int-res.com","title":"Behavioural estimation of blue whale movements in the Northeast Pacific from state-space model analysis of satellite tracks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/esr/v10/p93-106/","volume":"10"},

Toward building an amphibious legged robot, we present a morphing limb that can adapt its structure and stiffness for amphibious operation. We draw inspiration for the limb’s design from the morphologies of sea turtle ﬂippers and land-faring tortoise legs. Turtles and tortoises have rigid hulls that can be emulated in amphibious robots to provide a convenient, protected volume for motors, electronics, power supply, and payloads. Each of these animals’ limbs are tailored for locomotion in their respective environments. A sea turtle ﬂipper has a streamlined proﬁle to reduce drag, making it apt for swimming. A land tortoise leg boasts a strong, expanded cross-section conducive to load-bearing. We capture the morphological advantages of both animals’ limbs in our morphing limb via a variable stiffness composite coupled to a pneumatic actuator system that enables on-demand transitions between leg and ﬂipper conﬁgurations. We control the degree of stiffness of the limb by varying electrical input to ﬂexible heaters bound to the thermally responsive variable stiffness composite. The proposed morphing amphibious limb design is promising for enabling the next generation of hybrid soft-rigid robots to adapt to unstructured environments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Baines","given":"Robert L."},{"family":"Booth","given":"Joran W."},{"family":"Fish","given":"Frank E."},{"family":"Kramer-Bottiglio","given":"Rebecca"}],"citation-key":"baines_etal19","container-title":"2019 2nd IEEE International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft)","DOI":"10.1109/ROBOSOFT.2019.8722772","event-place":"Seoul, Korea (South)","event-title":"2019 2nd IEEE International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft)","ISBN":"978-1-5386-9260-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"704-710","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Seoul, Korea (South)","source":"Crossref","title":"Toward a bio-inspired variable-stiffness morphing limb for amphibious robot locomotion","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8722772/"},
  {"id":"baines_etal22","abstract":"Following the cessation of whaling, the southwest Atlantic humpback whale ( Megaptera novaeangliae ) population is thought to be close to pre-exploitation size, reversing 20th century changes in abundance. Using a model-based approach applied to concurrently collected data on baleen whale abundance and Antarctic krill ( Euphausia superba ) biomass in the South Sandwich Islands (SSI) region, we explore ecological interactions between these taxa. Krill biomass and baleen whale density were highest to the north and northeast of the SSI, where the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is deflected around the island chain. Humpback whale density was elevated at locations of krill biomass density >150 gm -2 . Krill consumption by baleen whales was estimated at 19–29% of the available krill standing stock. We used historic whaling data to confirm the plausibility of these consumption rates and found evidence of rapid weight gain in humpback whales, such that blubber depleted during the breeding season could be restored in a much shorter period than previously assumed. Little is known about krill replenishment rates in the flow of the ACC, or about niche separation between recovering baleen whale populations; both factors may affect species carrying capacities and further monitoring will be required to inform the management of human activities in the region. • Krill biomass density distribution was modelled using a two-stage Maxent/GLM process. • Humpback whale abundance and distribution was modelled using a GAM. • Whales consume 19–29% of available krill in the South Sandwich Islands region. • On southern feeding grounds humpback whales can rapidly restore depleted blubber. • Future studies on rates of krill transport in oceanographic currents will be important.","author":[{"family":"Baines","given":"Mick"},{"family":"Jackson","given":"J.A."},{"family":"Fielding","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Warwick-Evans","given":"Victoria"},{"family":"Reichelt","given":"Maren"},{"literal":"Claire Lacey"},{"literal":"Simon Pinder"},{"literal":"P.N.

The biomass of cetacean species in the California Current is calculated as the product of their mean summer and fall abundance during 1991 to 2005 and estimates of mean mass ind.–1. Total prey consumption by cetaceans is estimated from a mass-specific consumption model. NPP is estimated from remote satellite measurements using the Behrenfeld-Falkowski vertically-generalized production model for each of 4 geographic regions. The total biomass of baleen whales exceeds the biomass of toothed whales by a factor of ~2.5; however, the estimated prey consumption by these taxa is nearly equal. Assuming 10% trophic transfer efficiency, cetaceans are estimated to require 32.2 g C m–2 yr–1 of primary production, or ~12% of the NPP in the study area, to sustain the prey that they directly consume. Because they feed at a lower trophic level, the primary production requirement (PPR) of baleen whales is ~13% of that of toothed whales, despite their 2.5-fold greater biomass. Uncertainty in trophic transfer efficiency results in the greatest uncertainty in estimating PPR for these upper trophic predators.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Barlow","given":"J"},{"family":"Kahru","given":"M"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Bg"}],"citation-key":"barlow_etal08","container-title":"Marine Ecology Progress Series","DOI":"10.3354/meps07695","ISSN":"0171-8630, 1616-1599","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"language":"en","page":"285-295","source":"Crossref","title":"Cetacean biomass, prey consumption, and primary production requirements in the California Current ecosystem","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v371/p285-295/","volume":"371"},

Satellite technology is now providing direct evidence on the lengths and durations of these flights and associated staging episodes for individual birds. Using this technology, we compared the migration performance of two subspecies of bar-tailed godwit Limosa lapponica travelling between non-breeding grounds in New Zealand (subspecies baueri) and northwest Australia (subspecies menzbieri) and breeding grounds in Alaska and eastern Russia, respectively. Individuals of both subspecies made long, usually non-stop, flights from non-breeding grounds to coastal staging grounds in the Yellow Sea region of East Asia (average 10 060 ± SD 290 km for baueri and 5860 ± 240 km for menzbieri). After an average stay of 41.2 ± 4.8 d, baueri flew over the North Pacific Ocean before heading northeast to the Alaskan breeding grounds (6770 ± 800 km). Menzbieri staged for 38.4 ± 2.5 d, and flew over land and sea northeast to high arctic Russia (4170 ± 370 km). The post-breeding journey for baueri involved several weeks of staging in southwest Alaska followed by non-stop flights across the Pacific Ocean to New Zealand (11 690 km in a complete track) or stopovers on islands in the southwestern Pacific en route to New Zealand and eastern Australia. By contrast, menzbieri returned to Australia via stopovers in the New Siberian Islands, Russia, and back at the Yellow Sea; birds travelled on average 4510 ± 360 km from Russia to the Yellow Sea, staged there for 40.8 ± 5.6 d, and then flew another 5680–7180 km to Australia (10 820 ± 300 km in total). Overall, the entire migration of the single baueri godwit with a fully completed return track totalled 29 280 km and involved 20 d of major migratory flight over a round-trip journey of 174 d. The entire migrations of menzbieri averaged 21 940 ± 570 km, including 14 d of major migratory flights out of 154 d total. Godwits of both populations exhibit extreme flight performance, and baueri makes the longest (southbound) and second-longest (northbound) non-stop migratory flights documented for any bird. Both subspecies essentially make single stops when moving between non-breeding and breeding sites in opposite hemispheres. This reinforces the critical importance of the intertidal habitats used by fuelling godwits in Australasia, the Yellow Sea, and Alaska.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Battley","given":"Phil F."},{"family":"Warnock","given":"Nils"},{"family":"Tibbitts","given":"T.

  {"id":"baumgartner_fratantoni08","abstract":"The daily activity cycles of marine predators may be dictated in large part by the timing of prey availability. For example, recent studies have observed diel periodicity in baleen whale vocalization rates that are thought to be governed by the diel vertical migration of their zooplanktonic prey. We addressed this hypothesis by studying associations between sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) vocalization rates, oceanographic conditions, and the vertical distribution of the whales' prey, the calanoid copepod Calanus finmarchicus, during May 2005 in the southwestern Gulf of Maine using an array of autonomous ocean gliders. Each of the four gliders was equipped with sensors to measure temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll fluorescence. Three of the four gliders carried a digital acoustic recorder and the fourth carried a 1-MHz acoustic Doppler current profiler. We observed strong diel periodicity in the acoustic backscatter measured by the current profiler that we attribute (based on a corroborating shipboard study) to the diel vertical migration of C. finmarchicus. Sei whale vocalization rates also exhibited diel periodicity, with more calls detected during the daytime when C. finmarchicus was observed at depth. We found no evidence to suggest that the observed patterns in sei whale calling rates were attributable to diel periodicity in background noise or acoustic propagation conditions. Sei whales are adept at foraging on nearsurface aggregations of C. finmarchicus; therefore we expect that the whales were feeding at night. We hypothesize that calling rates are reduced at night while the whales are feeding, but increase with social activity during the day when copepods are either more difficult or less efficient to capture at depth. The gliders' persistence during adverse weather conditions experienced during the study allowed continuous collocated observations of whale vocalization behavior and oceanographic conditions that have not been previously possible with traditional shipboard techniques.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Baumgartner","given":"Mark F."},{"family":"Fratantoni","given":"David M."}],"citation-key":"baumgartner_fratantoni08","container-title":"Limnology and Oceanography","DOI":"10.4319/lo.2008.53.5_part_2.2197","ISSN":"1939-5590","issue":"5part2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"language":"en","page":"2197-2209","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Diel periodicity in both sei whale vocalization rates and the vertical migration of their copepod prey observed from ocean gliders","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.4319/lo.2008.53.5_part_2.2197","volume":"53"},

Spatially explicit predictions of whales’ behavioral responses were combined with density predictions from previous species distribution models (SDM) and vessel tracking data to estimate the relative probability of vessels encountering whales and identifying areas where interaction is likely to occur. These estimations were conducted independently for the aquaculture, transport, artisanal fishery, and industrial fishery fleets operating in NCP. Blue whale movement patterns strongly agreed with SDM results, reinforcing our knowledge regarding oceanographic habitat selection drivers.

  {"id":"bejan_marden06","abstract":"Summary Biologists have treated the view that fundamental differences exist between running, ﬂying and swimming as evident, because the forms of locomotion and the animals are so different: limbs and wings vs body undulations, neutrally buoyant vs weighted bodies, etc. Here we show that all forms of locomotion can be described by a single physics theory. The theory is an invocation of the principle that ﬂow systems evolve in such a way that they destroy minimum useful energy (exergy, food). This optimization approach delivers in surprisingly direct fashion the observed relations between speed and body mass (Mb) raised to 1/6, and between frequency (stride, ﬂapping) and Mb–1/6, and shows why these relations hold for running, ﬂying and swimming. Animal locomotion is an optimized two-step intermittency: an optimal balance is achieved between the vertical loss of useful energy (lifting the body weight, which later drops), and the horizontal loss caused by friction against the surrounding medium. The theory predicts additional features of animal design: the Strouhal number constant, which holds for running as well as ﬂying and swimming, the proportionality between force output and mass in animal motors, and the fact that undulating swimming and ﬂapping ﬂight occur only if the body Reynolds number exceeds approximately 30. This theory, and the general body of work known as constructal theory, together now show that animal movement (running, ﬂying, swimming) and ﬂuid eddy movement (turbulent structure) are both forms of optimized intermittent movement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Bejan","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Marden","given":"James H."}],"citation-key":"bejan_marden06","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Biology","DOI":"10.1242/jeb.01974","ISSN":"0022-0949, 1477-9145","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"language":"en","page":"238-248","source":"Crossref","title":"Unifying constructal theory for scale effects in running, swimming and flying","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/doi/10.1242/jeb.01974","volume":"209"},
  {"id":"bejder_etal19","abstract":"Understanding the behaviour of humpback whale mother-calf pairs and the acoustic environment on their breeding grounds is fundamental to assessing the biological and ecological requirements needed to ensure a successful migration and survival of calves. Therefore, on a breeding/resting ground, Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia, we used animal-borne DTAGs to quantify the fine-scale behaviour and energetic expenditure of humpback whale mothers and calves, while sound recorders measured the acoustic environment. We show that: (i) lactating humpback whales keep their energy expenditure low by devoting a significant amount of time to rest, and their use of energy, inferred from respiration rates, is ~half than that of adults on their foraging grounds; (ii) lactating females mainly rest while stationary at shallow depths within reach of the hull of commercial ships, thus increasing the potential for ship strike collisions; (iii) the soundscape is dominated by biological sources; and (iv) even moderate increases of noise from vessels will decrease the communication range of humpback whales. Planned commercial infrastructure in Exmouth Gulf will cause a substantial increase in shipping traffic with the risk of ship strikes and acoustic disturbance potentially compromising energy reserves for the southern migration of humpback whales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Bejder","given":"L."},{"family":"Videsen","given":"S."},{"family":"Hermannsen","given":"L."},{"family":"Simon","given":"M."},{"family":"Hanf","given":"D."},{"family":"Madsen","given":"P.

  {"id":"bernaldodequiros_etal19","abstract":"Mass stranding events (MSEs) of beaked whales (BWs) were extremely rare prior to the 1960s but increased markedly after the development of naval mid-frequency active sonar (MFAS). The temporal and spatial associations between atypical BW MSEs and naval exercises were first observed in the Canary Islands, Spain, in the mid-1980s. Further research on BWs stranded in association with naval exercises demonstrated pathological findings consistent with decompression sickness (DCS). A 2004 ban on MFASs around the Canary Islands successfully prevented additional BW MSEs in the region, but atypical MSEs have continued in other places of the world, especially in the Mediterranean Sea, with examined individuals showing DCS. A workshop held in Fuerteventura, Canary Islands, in September 2017 reviewed current knowledge on BW atypical MSEs associated with MFAS. Our review suggests that the effects of MFAS on BWs vary among individuals or populations, and predisposing factors may contribute to individual outcomes. Spatial management specific to BW habitat, such as the MFAS ban in the Canary Islands, has proven to be an effective mitigation tool and mitigation measures should be established in other areas taking into consideration known population-level information. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

  {"id":"berta_etal15","abstract":"Information is scarce on gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) anatomy and that of mysticetes in general. Dissection of the head of a neonatal gray whale revealed novel anatomical details of the eye, blowhole, incisive papilla with associated nasopalatine ducts, sensory hairs, and throat grooves. Compared to a similar sized right whale calf, the gray whale eyeball is nearly twice as long. The nasal cartilages of the gray whale, located between the blowholes, differ from the bowhead in having accessory cartilages. A small, fleshy incisive papilla bordered by two blind nasopalatine pits near the palate’s rostral tip, previously undescribed in gray whales, may be associated with the vomeronasal organ, although histological evidence is needed for definitive identification. Less well known among mysticetes are the numerous elongated, stiff sensory hairs (vibrissae) observed on the gray whale rostrum from the ventral tip to the blowhole and on the mandible. These hairs are concentrated on the chin, and those on the lower jaw are arranged in a V-shaped pattern. We confirm the presence of two primary, anteriorly converging throat grooves, confined to the throat region similar to those of ziphiid and physeteroid odontocetes. A third, shorter groove occurs lateral to the left primary groove. The throat grooves in the gray whale have been implicated in gular expansion during suction feeding. Anat Rec, 298:648–659, 2015.

  {"id":"best01","abstract":"A review of available catch and biological data suggests that there are 3 populations of Bryde¹s whales in the southern African region. An inshore population (the South African Inshore Stock) occurs over the continental shelf of South Africa,\nsouth of about 30°S, and seems to be non-migratory, although there is a movement up the west coast in winter. A pelagic population (the Southeast Atlantic Stock) occurs on the west coast of southern Africa, ranging from equatorial regions to about 34°S,\nand appears to migrate north in autumn and south in spring. Whales from the Southeast Atlantic Stock differ from the South African Inshore Stock in size, scarring, baleen shape, seasonality of reproduction, fecundity and prey types. Both occurred in the\nwest coast whaling ground off Donkergat, but with differing seasonalities and distributions from the coast. Bryde¹s whales are rare on the east coast of southern Africa, but are found in summer in some numbers south of Madagascar. Whales from this\npopulation are clearly smaller than those from the Southeast Atlantic Stock, but are similar in size to, or even smaller than, those from the South African Inshore Stock. Their external appearance is unknown, but they differ in prey type from the South\nAfrican Inshore Stock, and because of a clear discontinuity in distribution it is believed that they form a third (pelagic) population (the Southwest Indian Ocean Stock). This population may or may not move north as far as the Seychelles in winter, but\nseems to be separate from Bryde¹s whales in the Arabian Sea. From their size composition, length at sexual maturity and infrequent capture, Bryde¹s whales taken at Durban may have represented strays from either the South African Inshore Stock or the\nSouthwest Indian Ocean Stock, and recorded stomach contents also indicate prey types common to either stock. The unusual degree of population differentiation shown by Bryde¹s whales may be a consequence of their limited seasonal migrations and apparent\nresource partitioning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Best","given":"P.B."}],"citation-key":"best01","container-title":"Marine Ecology Progress Series","DOI":"10.3354/meps220277","ISSN":"0171-8630, 1616-1599","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001,9,27]]},"language":"en","page":"277-289","source":"www.int-res.com","title":"Distribution and population separation of Bryde's whale Balaenoptera edeni off southern Africa","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v220/p277-289/","volume":"220"},
  {"id":"bestley_etal19","abstract":"Humpback whale populations migrate extensively between winter breeding grounds and summer feeding grounds, however known links to remote Antarctic feeding grounds remain limited in many cases. New satellite tracks detail humpback whale migration pathways from Western Australia into the Southern Ocean. These highlight a focal feeding area during austral spring and early summer at the southern Kerguelen plateau, in a western boundary current where a sharp northward turn and retroflection of ocean fronts occurs along the eastern plateau edge. The topographic steering of oceanographic features here likely supports a predictable, productive and persistent forage ground. The spatial distribution of whaling catches and Discovery era mark-recaptures confirms the importance of this region to Western Australian humpback whales since at least historical times. Movement modelling discriminates sex-related behaviours, with females moving faster during both transit and resident periods, which may be a consequence of size or indicate differential energetic requirements. Relatively short and directed migratory pathways overall, together with high-quality, reliable forage resources may provide a partial explanation for the ongoing strong recovery demonstrated by this population. The combination of new oceanographic information and movement data provides enhanced understanding of important biological processes, which are relevant within the context of the current spatial management and conservation efforts in the Southern Ocean.","author":[{"family":"Bestley","given":"Sophie"},{"literal":"Andrews-Goff"},{"family":"Andrews-Goff","given":"Virginia"},{"literal":"Virginia Andrews-Goff"},{"family":"Wijk","given":"Esmee","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Wijk","given":"E","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"literal":"Rintoul"},{"family":"Rintoul","given":"Stephen R."},{"family":"Double","given":"Michael C."},{"family":"Double","given":"Mike"},{"literal":"J How"},{"literal":"Jason How"},{"family":"How","given":"Jason"}],"citation-key":"bestley_etal19","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-019-50497-2","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,27]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2976911723","page":"13988-13988","title":"New insights into prime Southern Ocean forage grounds for thriving Western Australian humpback whales","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"bierlich_etal21","abstract":"Increasingly, drone-based photogrammetry has been used to measure size and body condition changes in marine megafauna. A broad range of platforms, sensors, and altimeters are being applied for these purposes, but there is no unified way to predict photogrammetric uncertainty across this methodological spectrum. As such, it is difficult to make robust comparisons across studies, disrupting collaborations amongst researchers using platforms with varying levels of measurement accuracy. Here we built off previous studies quantifying uncertainty and used an experimental approach to train a Bayesian statistical model using a known-sized object floating at the water’s surface to quantify how measurement error scales with altitude for several different drones equipped with different cameras, focal length lenses, and altimeters. We then applied the fitted model to predict the length distributions and estimate age classes of unknown-sized humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae, as well as to predict the population-level morphological relationship between rostrum to blowhole distance and total body length of Antarctic minke whales Balaenoptera bonaerensis. This statistical framework jointly estimates errors from altitude and length measurements from multiple observations and accounts for altitudes measured with both barometers and laser altimeters while incorporating errors specific to each. This Bayesian model outputs a posterior predictive distribution of measurement uncertainty around length measurements and allows for the construction of highest posterior density intervals to define measurement uncertainty, which allows one to make probabilistic statements and stronger inferences pertaining to morphometric features critical for understanding life history patterns and potential impacts from anthropogenically altered habitats.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Bierlich","given":"Kc"},{"family":"Schick","given":"Rs"},{"family":"Hewitt","given":"J"},{"family":"Dale","given":"J"},{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Ja"},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"As"},{"family":"Johnston","given":"Dw"}],"citation-key":"bierlich_etal21","container-title":"Marine Ecology Progress Series","container-title-short":"Mar.

  {"id":"blake04","abstract":"Classifications of fish swimming are reviewed as a prelude to discussing functional design and performance in an ecological context. Webb (1984a, 1998) classified fishes based on body shape and locomotor mode into three basic categories: body and caudal fin (BCF) periodic, BCF transient (fast-starts, turns) and median and paired fin (MPF) swimmers. Swimming performance and functional design is discussed for each of these categories. Webb hypothesized that specialization in any given category would limit performance in any other. For example, routine MPF swimmers should be penalized in BCF transient (fast-start propulsion). Recent studies offer much support for Webb's construct but also suggest some necessary amendments. In particular, design and performance compromises for different swimming modes are associated with fish that employ the same propulsor for more than one task (coupled, e.g. the same propulsor for routine steady swimming and fast-starts). For example, pike (BCF transient specialist) achieve better acceleration performance than trout (generalist). Pike steady (BCF periodic) performance, however, is inferior to that of trout. Fish that employ different propulsors for different tasks (decoupled, e.g. MPF propulsion for low-speed routine swimming and BCF motions for fast-starts) do not show serious performance compromises. For example, certain MPF low-speed swimmers show comparable fast-start performance to BCF forms. Arguably, the evolution of decoupled locomotor systems was a major factor underlying the adaptive radiation of teleosts. Low-speed routine propulsion releases MPF swimmers from the morphological constraints imposed by streamlining allowing for a high degree of variability in form. This contrasts with BCF periodic swimming specialists where representatives of four vertebrate classes show evolutionary convergence on a single, optimal ‘thunniform’ design. However, recent experimental studies on the comparative performance of carangiform and thunniform swimmers contradict some of the predictions of hydromechanical models. This is addressed in regard to the swimming performance, energetics and muscle physiology of tuna. The concept of gait is reviewed in the context of coupled and decoupled locomotor systems. Biomimetic approaches to the development of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles have given a new context and impetus to research and this is discussed in relation to current views of fish functional design and swimming performance. Suggestions are made for possible future research directions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Blake","given":"R.

  {"id":"blanckenhorn00","abstract":"It is widely agreed that fecundity selection and sexual selection are the major evolutionary forces that select for larger body size in most organisms. The general, equilibrium view is that selection for large body size is eventually counterbalanced by opposing selective forces. While the evidence for selection favoring larger body size is overwhelming, counterbalancing selection favoring small body size is often masked by the good condition of the larger organism and is therefore less obvious. The suggested costs of large size are: (1) viability costs in juveniles due to long development and/or fast growth; (2) viability costs in adults and juveniles due to predation, parasitism, or starvation because of reduced agility, increased detectability, higher energy requirements, heat stress, and/or intrinsic costs of reproduction; (3) decreased mating success of large males due to reduced agility and/or high energy requirements; and (4) decreased reproductive success of large females and males due to late reproduction. A review of the literature indicates a substantial lack of empirical evidence for these various mechanisms and highlights the need for experimental studies that specifically address the fitness costs of being large at the ecological, physiological, and genetic levels. Specifically, theoretical investigations and comprehensive case studies of particular model species are needed to elucidate whether sporadic selection in time and space is sufficient to counterbalance perpetual and strong selection for large body size.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Blanckenhorn","given":"Wolf U."}],"citation-key":"blanckenhorn00","container-title":"The Quarterly Review of Biology","ISSN":"0033-5770","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000]]},"page":"385-407","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Evolution of Body Size: What Keeps Organisms Small?","title-short":"The Evolution of Body Size","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2664968","volume":"75"},

  {"id":"block_etal16","abstract":"Animal telemetry is the science of elucidating the movements and behavior of animals in relation to their environment or habitat. Here, we focus on telemetry of aquatic species (marine mammals, sharks, fish, sea birds and turtles) and so are concerned with animal movements and behavior as they move through and above the world’s oceans, coastal rivers, estuaries and great lakes. Animal telemetry devices (“tags”) yield detailed data regarding animal responses to the coupled ocean–atmosphere and physical environment through which they are moving. Animal telemetry has matured and we describe a developing US Animal Telemetry Network (ATN) observing system that monitors aquatic life on a range of temporal and spatial scales that will yield both short- and long-term benefits, fill oceanographic observing and knowledge gaps and advance many of the U.S. National Ocean Policy Priority Objectives. ATN has the potential to create a huge impact for the ocean observing activities undertaken by the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) and become a model for establishing additional national-level telemetry networks worldwide. Telemetry can provide environmental, behavioral and physiological data in near-real time, or by use of archival tags in which the data are stored or later transmitted to satellites. Aquatic animal species tagged have ranged from 6-g salmon smolts to 150-ton whales. Detailed observations of animal movements and behavior in relation to critical habitats in their aquatic environment have significantly improved our understanding of ecosystem function and dynamics. These observations are critical for sustaining populations, conserving biodiversity and implementing ecosystem-based management through an increased understanding of ecosystem structures, functions, and processes, as well as their importance to ecosystem services and values. Sensors carried by tagged animals have come of age and deliver high-resolution physical oceanographic data at relatively low costs. Animals are particularly adept at helping scientists identify critical habitats, spawning locations, and important oceanographic features (e.g., fronts, eddies and upwelling areas). They also provide important insights into regions of the oceans that are difficult and expensive to monitor (e.g., offshore environments, Arctic). This paper focuses on how to integrate an operational ATN into U.S. IOOS. The development of U.S. IOOS initially focused on the acquisition and integration of physical and chemical oceanographic data. With this system now operational, U.S. IOOS is ready to add the acquisition of relevant biological observations, and to enhance the acquisition of physical and chemical oceanographic observations via ATN platforms. A U.S. ATN observing system that monitors aquatic life on a range of temporal and spatial scales could yield both short- and long-term benefits, fill oceanographic observing and knowledge gaps, and advance many of the National Ocean Policy Priority Objectives. ATN has the potential to create a huge impact for the ocean observing activities undertaken by IOOS and become a model for establishing additional national-level telemetry networks worldwide.","author":[{"family":"Block","given":"Barbara A."},{"family":"Holbrook","given":"Christopher M."},{"family":"Simmons","given":"Samantha E."},{"family":"Holland","given":"Kim N."},{"family":"Ault","given":"Jerald S."},{"family":"Costa","given":"Daniel P."},{"family":"Mate","given":"Bruce R."},{"family":"Seitz","given":"Andrew C."},{"family":"Arendt","given":"Michael D."},{"family":"Payne","given":"John"},{"family":"Payne","given":"John C."},{"family":"Mahmoudi","given":"Behzad"},{"family":"Moore","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Price","given":"James M."},{"family":"Levenson","given":"J.

Recent advances in biologging technology, including electronic tag miniaturization and improved animal movement models, have revolutionized our understanding of the ecology of top predators and have permitted observations well beyond the reach of standard measurement techniques. Engineering has provided the biologging community with ever more sophisticated tags, and advances in the application of statistical methods to interpret these data have yielded powerful new tools for understanding animal behavior. The technology has also reached sufficient sophistication and reliability such that the data collected is often equivalent to industry standards for environmental sampling, which has led to profound advancements in the marine realm, where the sheer vastness, in 3 dimensions, limits our ability to observe. Biologging data is now being increasingly applied to marine management and conservation policy. In this introduction, we highlight a few of the research themes presented at the Third International Conference on Biologging Science, and comment on the future challenges of biologging science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Bograd","given":"Steven J."},{"family":"Block","given":"Barbara A."},{"family":"Costa","given":"Daniel P."},{"family":"Godley","given":"Brendan J."}],"citation-key":"bograd_etal10","container-title":"Endangered Species Research","DOI":"10.3354/esr00269","ISSN":"1863-5407, 1613-4796","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","page":"1-7","source":"www.int-res.com","title":"Biologging technologies: new tools for conservation.

  {"id":"booth_etal23","abstract":"Bioenergetics is the study of how animals achieve energetic balance. Energetic balance results from the energetic expenditure of an individual and the energy they extract from their environment. Ingested energy depends on several extrinsic (e.g prey species, nutritional value and composition, prey density and availability) and intrinsic factors (e.g. foraging effort, success at catching prey, digestive processes and associated energy losses, and digestive capacity). While the focus in bioenergetic modelling is often on the energetic costs an animal incurs, the robust estimation of an individual’s energy intake is equally critical for producing meaningful predictions. Here, we review the components and processes that affect energy intake from ingested gross energy to biologically useful net energy (NE). The current state of knowledge of each parameter is reviewed, shedding light on research gaps to advance this field. The review highlighted that the foraging behaviour of many marine mammals is relatively well studied via biologging tags, with estimates of success rate typically assumed for most species. However, actual prey capture success rates are often only assumed, although we note studies that provide approaches for its estimation using current techniques. A comprehensive collation of the nutritional content of marine mammal prey species revealed a robust foundation from which prey quality (comprising prey species, size and energy density) can be assessed, though data remain unavailable for many prey species. Empirical information on various energy losses following ingestion of prey was unbalanced among marine mammal species, with considerably more literature available for pinnipeds. An increased understanding and accurate estimate of each of the components that comprise a species NE intake are an integral part of bioenergetics. Such models provide a key tool to investigate the effects of disturbance on marine mammals at an individual and population level and to support effective conservation and management.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Booth","given":"Cormac G"},{"family":"Guilpin","given":"Marie"},{"family":"Darias-O’Hara","given":"Aimee-Kate"},{"family":"Ransijn","given":"Janneke M"},{"family":"Ryder","given":"Megan"},{"family":"Rosen","given":"Dave"},{"family":"Pirotta","given":"Enrico"},{"family":"Smout","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"McHuron","given":"Elizabeth A"},{"family":"Nabe-Nielsen","given":"Jacob"},{"family":"Costa","given":"Daniel P"}],"citation-key":"booth_etal23","container-title":"Conservation Physiology","container-title-short":"Conservation Physiology","DOI":"10.1093/conphys/coac083","ISSN":"2051-1434","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,1]]},"page":"coac083","source":"Silverchair","title":"Estimating energetic intake for marine mammal bioenergetic models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/conphys/coac083","volume":"11"},

Newfoundland (47⚬ 9' N. 55⚬ 25' W), were made to obtain estimates of volume and surface area of the animal. Detailed measurements of the flukes, both planform and sections, were also obtained. A strip theory was developed to calculate the hydrodynamic performance of the whale's flukes as an oscillating propeller. This method is based on linear, two-dimensional, small-amplitude, unsteady hydrofoil theory with correction factors used to acount for the effects of finite span and finite amplitude motion. These correction factors were developed from theoretical results of large-amplitude heaving motion and unsteady lifting-surface theory. A model that makes an estimate of the effects of viscous flow on propeller performance was superimposed on the potential-flow results. This model estimates the drag of the hydrofoil sections by assuming that the drag is similar to that of a hydrofoil section in steady flow. The performance characteristics of the flukes of the fin whale were estimated by using this method. The effects of the different correction factors, and of the frictional drag of the fluke sections, are emphasized. Frictional effects in particular were found to reduce the hydrodynamic efficiency of the flukes significantly.

  {"id":"bowlin_etal05","abstract":"Billions of songbirds migrate between continents each year, but we have yet to obtain enough information on in-flight physiology and energetics to fully understand the migratory behavior of any one species. New World Catharus thrushes are common nocturnal migrants amenable to biotelemetry, allowing us to measure physiological parameters during migratory flight in the wild. Here, we review work by the authors on Catharus thrush in-flight physiology during spring migration in continental North America and present new data on individual variation in energy use during migratory flight. Previous work demonstrated that (1) a number of simple behavioral rules are sufficient to explain the initiation of individual migratory flights made by Catharus thrushes, (2) the thrushes used a magnetic compass to orient during the night rather than celestial cues and that they calibrated this magnetic compass each day using cues associated with the setting sun, (3) in total, Catharus thrushes used approximately twice as much energy during stopovers than they used during migratory flight, and (4) thrushes may use more energy when thermoregulating on cold days than on days when they make short migratory flights. Recently, we built upon this work and used newly-developed transmitters to measure heart rate, wingbeat frequency and respiration rate of free-flying Swainson's Thrushes (C. ustulatus). We found a large amount of between-individual variation in average heart rate after ascent (range 12.06–14.81 Hz, mean ± SD, 13.48 ± 0.75, n = 10), average wingbeat frequency after ascent (10.25–11.75 Hz, 10.82 ± 0.49, n = 10), and the difference between the two variables (1.5–3.84 Hz, 2.53 ± 0.76, n = 8). Both heart rate and wingbeat frequency were significantly higher during ascent than later in the flight. We propose biotelemetry as a means to understand energetic trade-offs and decisions during natural migratory flight in songbirds. To further our knowledge of intercontinental songbird migration and the connectivity between wintering and breeding sites, we outline plans for a satellite-based global tracking system for &lt;1 g transmitters.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Bowlin","given":"Melissa S."},{"family":"Cochran","given":"William W."},{"family":"Wikelski","given":"Martin C."}],"citation-key":"bowlin_etal05","container-title":"Integrative and Comparative Biology","container-title-short":"Integrative and Comparative Biology","DOI":"10.1093/icb/45.2.295","ISSN":"1540-7063","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005]]},"page":"295-304","source":"Silverchair","title":"Biotelemetry of New World thrushes during migration: Physiology, energetics and orientation in the wild1","title-short":"Biotelemetry of New World thrushes during migration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/45.2.295","volume":"45"},

  {"id":"bradford_etal12","abstract":"The role of environmental limitation and density-dependent regulation in shaping populations is debated in ecology. Populations at low densities may offer an unobstructed view of basic environmental and physiological interactions that impact individual fitness and thus population productivity. The energy reserves of an organism are reflected in its body condition, a measure linking individual fitness and the environment. From 1997 to 2007, we monitored the critically endangered western gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) population on its primary summer feeding ground off the northeastern coast of Sakhalin Island, Russia. This effort resulted in a large data set of photo-identification images from 5,007 sightings of 168 individual whales that we used to visually assess western gray whale body condition. We quantified temporal variation in the resulting 1,539 monthly body condition determinations with respect to observations of reproductive status and sex. Western gray whale body condition varied annually, and we identified years of significantly better (2004) and worse (1999, 2006, and 2007) body condition. This study is the 1st to track the within-season body condition of individual whales. Body condition improved significantly as the summer progressed, although results suggest that not all whales replenish their energy stores by the end of the season. The body condition of lactating females was significantly worse than that of other whales at all times and was most often determined to be compromised. The body condition of their weaning calves exhibited no temporal variation and was consistently good. It is possible lactating females provide an energetic buffer to their offspring at the expense of their own body condition and future reproductive success. Findings from the analysis establish a foundation for quantifying links between western gray whale body condition, demographic parameters, and environmental conditions; and provide a baseline for monitoring individual and population condition of an ecosystem sentinel species in a changing environment. Overall, this study highlights the presence of density-independent environmental and physiological mechanisms that affect the abundance and growth of populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Bradford","given":"Amanda L."},{"family":"Weller","given":"David W."},{"family":"Punt","given":"André E."},{"family":"Ivashchenko","given":"Yulia V."},{"family":"Burdin","given":"Alexander M."},{"family":"VanBlaricom","given":"Glenn R."},{"family":"Brownell","given":"Robert L.","suffix":"Jr."}],"citation-key":"bradford_etal12","container-title":"Journal of Mammalogy","container-title-short":"Journal of Mammalogy","DOI":"10.1644/11-MAMM-A-091.1","ISSN":"0022-2372","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"page":"251-266","source":"Silverchair","title":"Leaner leviathans: body condition variation in a critically endangered whale population","title-short":"Leaner leviathans","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1644/11-MAMM-A-091.1","volume":"93"},

  {"id":"bredin85","abstract":"Off the coast of Newfoundland humpback whales fee primarily on capelin which form schools of varying size, depth and age class. Observations were made on humpbacks foraging in six different prey situations, in each of which the distribution, abundance and behaviour of whales was related to bait characteristics. Whales were followed by boat and prey school information was provided by a paper printout depth sounder. -- When whales were exploiting large deep immature or post-spawning capelin schools, dive times were positively correlated with depths to the top of the prey school and to the ocean floor in the immediate dive vicinity. Time spent at depth (filtering time) appears to be constant (t = 2.3 min) while dive time is proportional to prey depth. Surface times were positively correlated with dive times and with prey school and water depth and appear to function as a recovery period from foraging dives. When preying upon small concentrated schools of post-spawning capelin, water depth and vertical extent of prey school did not significantly predict either dive time or surface time. The time spent and the large amounts of directional change that occurred while whales were at the surface may function to reposition whales close to the prey school. When the concentrated post-spawning capelin schools dispersed into very small widely scattered schools, whales spent variable amounts of time at the surface travelling primarily in straight lines from school to school, diving only once into each pocket of bait. Surface and dive times were not correlated with vertical extent of prey or with water depth. Humpbacks were also observed to exploit small surface swarms of krill, using a foraging strategy distinct from that seen when feeding on capelin: a series of lateral lunges at the surface.  -- A dominant feature of humpback whale foraging is the formation of highly coordinated groups. It is hypothesized that coordination functions to minimize the disruptive effects that repeated dives of foraging whales may have on prey schools. When prey schools were large, whales foraged almost continuously and formed larger groups. Whales left small prey schools after 0.t -2.0 h exploitation to travel and to rest, possibly letting the school regroup before returning to forage. Group sizes were larger when whales were foraging than when not foraging. Local whale populations were greater and whales stayed longer where prey was more abundant.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Bredin","given":"Katherine Alberta"}],"citation-key":"bredin85","genre":"masters","issued":{"date-parts":[[1985]]},"language":"en","license":"thesis_license","publisher":"Memorial University of Newfoundland","source":"research.library.mun.ca","title":"Foraging ecology of humpback whales off Newfoundland","type":"thesis","URL":"https://research.library.mun.ca/5881/"},

Several models of particle movement were evaluated and a model for great-circle motion found to give reasonable results for the movement of an adult female. This model takes specific account of the fact that the movement is on the surface of a sphere and that the animal is apparently heading toward a particular destination. The parameters of the motion were estimated. Such a great-circle path of migration may imply that these seals have the ability to assess their position with respect to some global or celestial cues, allowing them to continually adjust their course and achieve the most direct geodesic route between origin and destination of migration. But the navigational mechanism actually used by these seals to accomplish such feats is as yet unknown.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Brillinger","given":"David R."},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Brent S."}],"citation-key":"brillinger_stewart98","container-title":"Canadian Journal of Statistics","DOI":"10.2307/3315767","ISSN":"1708-945X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998]]},"language":"en","page":"431-443","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Elephant-seal movements: Modelling migration","title-short":"Elephant-seal movements","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2307/3315767","volume":"26"},
  {"id":"brodie75","abstract":"Standard metabolism is estimated for the fin whale, Balaenoptera physalus, from the energy yield of lipid stores consumed while in regions of limited prey availability. The metabolic rate appears better described by a surface rather than a volumetric rule. The larger body size of some Antarctic Balaenoptera compared with those of the Northern Hemisphere is attributed to selection for body proportions that reduce the specific metabolic rate and establish an optimal surface area for deposition of a lipid cache. Such proportions allow short—term forays into areas where prey is extremely dense but of restricted seasonal availability, and permit extended use of lipid stores during exclusion to warmer but less productive waters. Thus, adult body size within species is inversely correlated with the length of the feeding season and directly correlated with prey availability during that period. As differences in diversity of prey and/or their year—round availability become less marked between hemispheres, so do the body—size differences of the lesser rorquals. This is also applied to odontocetes. Thermal homeostasis is considered to be equally dependent upon morphology and behavior. Minimal densities of prey necessary for the maintenance of rorquals could be estimated from certain known parameters.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Brodie","given":"P.

  {"id":"brown12","abstract":"Tool use was once considered the sole domain of humans. Over the last 40 years, however, it has become apparent that tool use may be widespread across the animal kingdom. Pioneering studies in primates have shaped the way we think about tool use in animals, but have also lead to a bias both in terms of our expectations about which animals should be capable of using tools and the working definition of tool use. Here I briefly examine tool use in terrestrial animals and consider the constraints of the current working definition of tool use in fishes. Fishes lack grasping limbs and operate underwater where there are clear constraints with respect to the physics of tool use that differ dramatically from the terrestrial environment. I then examine all of the documented accounts of tool use in fishes. The review reveals that tool use seems to be confined to a limited number of fish taxa, particularly the wrasse, which may show similarities with the greater than expected number of examples of tool use in primates and corvids amongst mammals and birds, respectively. As fish are seldom studied as intensely as birds and mammals, there is a clear need for further observation of tool use in fishes. It is likely that further examples will be unveiled allowing us to perform comparative analyses of the evolution of tool use in fish.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Culum"}],"citation-key":"brown12","container-title":"Fish and Fisheries","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00451.x","ISSN":"1467-2979","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","page":"105-115","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Tool use in fishes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00451.x","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"budick_omalley00","abstract":"Summary Larval zebraﬁsh (Brachydanio rerio) are a popular model system because of their genetic attributes, transparency and relative simplicity. They have approximately 200 neurons that project from the brainstem into the spinal cord. Many of these neurons can be individually identiﬁed and laser-ablated in intact larvae. This should facilitate cellular-level characterization of the descending control of larval behavior patterns. Towards this end, we attempt to describe the range of locomotor behavior patterns exhibited by zebraﬁsh larvae. Using high-speed digital imaging, a variety of swimming and turning behaviors were analyzed in 6- to 9-day-old larval ﬁsh. Swimming episodes appeared to fall into two categories, with the point of maximal bending of the larva’s body occurring either near the mid-body (burst swims) or closer to the tail (slow swims). Burst swims also involved larger-amplitude bending, faster speeds and greater yaw than slow swims. Turning behaviors clearly fell into two distinct categories: fast, large-angle escape turns characteristic of escape responses, and much slower routine turns lacking the large counterbend that often accompanies escape turns. Prey-capture behaviors were also recorded. They were made up of simpler locomotor components that appeared to be similar to routine turns and slow swims. The different behaviors observed were analyzed with regard to possible underlying neural control systems. Our analysis suggests the existence of discrete sets of controlling neurons and helps to explain the need for the roughly 200 spinal-projecting nerve cells in the brainstem of the larval zebraﬁsh.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Budick","given":"S.A."},{"family":"O'Malley","given":"D.M."}],"citation-key":"budick_omalley00","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Biology","DOI":"10.1242/jeb.203.17.2565","ISSN":"1477-9145, 0022-0949","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000]]},"language":"en","page":"2565-2579","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Locomotor repertoire of the larval zebrafish: swimming, turning and prey capture","title-short":"Locomotor repertoire of the larval zebrafish","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/203/17/2565/8528/Locomotor-repertoire-of-the-larval-zebrafish","volume":"203"},

  {"id":"burnett_etal19","abstract":"Small unmanned aircraft systems (sUASs) are fostering novel approaches to marine mammal research, including baleen whale photogrammetry, by providing new observational perspectives. We collected vertical images of 89 gray and 6 blue whales using low cost sUASs to examine the accuracy of image based morphometry. Moreover, measurements from 192 images of a 1 m calibration object were used to examine four different scaling correction models. Results indicate that a linear mixed model including an error term for flight and date contained 0.17 m less error and 0.25 m less bias than no correction. We used the propagation uncertainty law to examine error contributions from scaling and image measurement (digitization) to determine that digitization accounted for 97% of total variance. Additionally, we present a new whale body size metric termed Body Area Index (BAI).

  {"id":"burns_bloom20","abstract":"Migratory animals respond to environmental heterogeneity by predictably moving long distances in their lifetime. Migration has evolved repeatedly in animals, and many adaptations are found across the tree of life that increase migration efficiency. Life-history theory predicts that migratory species should evolve a larger body size than non-migratory species, and some empirical studies have shown this pattern. A recent study analysed the evolution of body size between diadromous and non-diadromous shads, herrings, anchovies and allies, finding that species evolved larger body sizes when adapting to a diadromous lifestyle. It remains unknown whether different fish clades adapt to migration similarly. We used an adaptive landscape framework to explore body size evolution for over 4500 migratory and non-migratory species of ray-finned fishes. By fitting models of macroevolution, we show that migratory species are evolving towards a body size that is larger than non-migratory species. Furthermore, we find that migratory lineages evolve towards their optimal body size more rapidly than non-migratory lineages, indicating body size is a key adaption for migratory fishes. Our results show, for the first time, that the largest vertebrate radiation on the planet exhibited strong evolutionary determinism when adapting to a migratory lifestyle.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Burns","given":"Michael D."},{"family":"Bloom","given":"Devin D."}],"citation-key":"burns_bloom20","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2019.2615","issue":"1918","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"20192615","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Migratory lineages rapidly evolve larger body sizes than non-migratory relatives in ray-finned fishes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2019.2615","volume":"287"},

Accurate interpretation of isotope data depends on understanding isotopic incorporation rates for metabolically active tissues and growth rates for metabolically inert tissues. The aim of this research was to estimate isotopic incorporation rates in blue whale skin and baleen growth rates by using natural gradients in baseline isotope values between oceanic regions. Nitrogen (δ15N) and carbon (δ13C) isotope values of blue whale skin and potential prey were analyzed from three foraging zones (Gulf of California, California Current System, and Costa Rica Dome) in the northeast Pacific from 1996–2015. We also measured δ15N and δ13C values along the lengths of baleen plates collected from six blue whales stranded in the 1980s and 2000s. Skin was separated into three strata: basale, externum, and sloughed skin. A mean (±SD) skin isotopic incorporation rate of 163±91 days was estimated by fitting a generalized additive model of the seasonal trend in δ15N values of skin strata collected in the Gulf of California and the California Current System. A mean (±SD) baleen growth rate of 15.5±2.2 cm y-1 was estimated by using seasonal oscillations in δ15N values from three whales. These oscillations also showed that individual whales have a high fidelity to distinct foraging zones in the northeast Pacific across years. The absence of oscillations in δ15N values of baleen sub-samples from three male whales suggests these individuals remained within a specific zone for several years prior to death. δ13C values of both whale tissues (skin and baleen) and potential prey were not distinct among foraging zones. Our results highlight the importance of considering tissue isotopic incorporation and growth rates when studying migratory mysticetes and provide new insights into the individual movement strategies of blue whales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Busquets-Vass","given":"Geraldine"},{"family":"Newsome","given":"Seth D."},{"family":"Calambokidis","given":"John"},{"family":"Serra-Valente","given":"Gabriela"},{"family":"Jacobsen","given":"Jeff K."},{"family":"Aguíñiga-García","given":"Sergio"},{"family":"Gendron","given":"Diane"}],"citation-key":"busquets-vass_etal17","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0177880","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,31]]},"language":"en","page":"e0177880","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Estimating blue whale skin isotopic incorporation rates and baleen growth rates: Implications for assessing diet and movement patterns in mysticetes","title-short":"Estimating blue whale skin isotopic incorporation rates and baleen growth rates","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0177880","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"cade_etal20","abstract":"The unique engulfment filtration strategy of microphagous rorqual whales has evolved relatively recently (<5 Ma) and exploits extreme predator/prey size ratios to overcome the maneuverability advantages of swarms of small prey, such as krill. Forage fish, in contrast, have been engaged in evolutionary arms races with their predators for more than 100 million years and have performance capabilities that suggest they should easily evade whale-sized predators, yet they are regularly hunted by some species of rorqual whales. To explore this phenomenon, we determined, in a laboratory setting, when individual anchovies initiated escape from virtually approaching whales, then used these results along with in situ humpback whale attack data to model how predator speed and engulfment timing affected capture rates. Anchovies were found to respond to approaching visual looming stimuli at expansion rates that give ample chance to escape from a sea lion-sized predator, but humpback whales could capture as much as 30–60% of a school at once because the increase in their apparent (visual) size does not cross their prey’s response threshold until after rapid jaw expansion. Humpback whales are, thus, incentivized to delay engulfment until they are very close to a prey school, even if this results in higher hydrodynamic drag. This potential exaptation of a microphagous filter feeding strategy for fish foraging enables humpback whales to achieve 7× the energetic efficiency (per lunge) of krill foraging, allowing for flexible foraging strategies that may underlie their ecological success in fluctuating oceanic conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Cade","given":"David E."},{"family":"Carey","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Domenici","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Potvin","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Jeremy A."}],"citation-key":"cade_etal20","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1911099116","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","page":"472-478","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Predator-informed looming stimulus experiments reveal how large filter feeding whales capture highly maneuverable forage fish","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1911099116","volume":"117"},

How this largest fish thrives in tropical environments that promote high metabolism but support less robust zooplankton communities has not been sufficiently explained. We used open-source inertial measurement units (IMU) to log 397 h of whale shark behavior in Yucatán, Mexico, at a site of both active feeding and intense wildlife tourism. Here we show that the strategies employed by whale sharks to compensate for the increased drag of an open mouth are similar to ram feeders five orders of magnitude smaller and one order of magnitude larger. Presumed feeding constituted 20% of the total time budget of four sharks, with individual feeding bouts lasting up to 11 consecutive hours. Compared with normal, sub-surface swimming, three sharks increased their stroke rate and amplitude while surface feeding, while one shark that fed at depth did not demonstrate a greatly increased energetic cost. Additionally, based on time-depth budgets, we estimate that aerial surveys of shark populations should consider including a correction factor of 3 to account for the proportion of daylight hours that sharks are not visible at the surface. With foraging bouts generally lasting several hours, interruptions to foraging during critical feeding periods may represent substantial energetic costs to these endangered species, and this study presents baseline data from which management decisions affecting tourist interactions with whale sharks may be made.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Cade","given":"David E."},{"family":"Levenson","given":"J.

  {"id":"cade_etal21","abstract":"Large groups of animals aggregate around resource hotspots, with group size often influenced by the heterogeneity of the environment. In most cases, the foraging success of individuals within groups is interdependent, scaling either constructively or destructively with group size. Here we used biologging tags, acoustic prey mapping, passive acoustic recording of social cues and remote sensing of surface currents to investigate an alternative scenario in which large, dense aggregations of southeast Atlantic humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, and northeast Pacific blue whales, Balaenoptera musculus, were each associated with ephemeral krill aggregations large enough such that their availability to predators appeared to be influenced more by environmental features than by consumption, implying independence of group size and consumption rates. We found that the temporal scale and spatial extent of oceanographic drivers were consistent with the temporal scale and locations of predator aggregations, and additionally found that groups formed above bathymetric features known to promote zooplankton concentration. Additionally, we found calling behaviour counter-indicative of competition: blue whale foraging calls were anomalously high during observed aggregation time periods, suggesting signalling behaviour that could alert conspecifics to the location of high-quality resources. Modelled results suggest that the use of social information reduces the time required for individuals to discover and exploit high-quality resources, allowing for more efficient foraging without apparent costs to the caller. Thus, rorqual whales foraging in these environments appear to exhibit a social foraging strategy whereby a behaviour with negligible individual costs (signalling) provides information that enhances group foraging efficiency. The population density dependence of this social foraging strategy may help explain why some rorqual species were at first slow to recover from human exploitation, but have since increased more rapidly.","author":[{"family":"Cade","given":"David E."},{"family":"Fahlbusch","given":"James A."},{"family":"Oestreich","given":"William K."},{"family":"Ryan","given":"John P."},{"family":"Calambokidis","given":"John"},{"family":"Findlay","given":"Ken P."},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari S."},{"family":"Hazen","given":"Elliott L."},{"family":"Seakamela","given":"S.

  {"id":"cade_etal21a","abstract":"Animals are distributed relative to the resources they rely upon, often scaling in abundance relative to available resources. Yet, in heterogeneously distributed environments, describing resource availability at relevant spatial scales remains a challenge in ecology, inhibiting understanding of predator distribution and foraging decisions. We investigated the foraging behaviour of two species of rorqual whales within spatially limited and numerically extraordinary super-aggregations in two oceans. We additionally described the lognormal distribution of prey data at species-specific spatial scales that matched the predator's unique lunge-feeding strategy. Here we show that both humpback whales off South Africa's west coast and blue whales off the US west coast perform more lunges per unit time within these aggregations than when foraging individually, and that the biomass within gulp-sized parcels was on average higher and more tightly distributed within super-group-associated prey patches, facilitating greater energy intake per feeding event as well as increased feeding rates. Prey analysis at predator-specific spatial scales revealed a stronger association of super-groups with patches containing relatively high geometric mean biomass and low geometric standard deviations than with arithmetic mean biomass, suggesting that the foraging decisions of rorqual whales may be more influenced by the distribution of high-biomass portions of a patch than total biomass. The hierarchical distribution of prey in spatially restricted, temporally transient, super-group-associated patches demonstrated high biomass and less variable distributions that facilitated what are likely near-minimum intervals between feeding events. Combining increased biomass with increased foraging rates implied that overall intake rates of whales foraging within super-groups were approximately double those of whales foraging in other environments. Locating large, high-quality prey patches via the detection of aggregation hotspots may be an important aspect of rorqual whale foraging, one that may have been suppressed when population sizes were anthropogenically reduced in the 20th century to critical lows.

To convert the raw voltages recorded by bio-logging sensors into biologically meaningful metrics of orientation (e.g., pitch, roll and heading), motion (e.g., speed, specific acceleration) and position (e.g., depth and spatial coordinates), we developed a series of MATLAB tools and online instructional tutorials.

We used suction-cup attached bio-logging tags and active acoustic prey mapping to test the hypothesis that whale abundance in Charlotte Bay would be associated with higher prey biomass density, and that whale foraging effort would be concentrated in regions of Charlotte Bay with the highest biomass. Here we show, however, that patch size and krill length at the depth of foraging were more likely predictors of foraging effort than biomass.

However, whales in Charlotte Bay foraged for 58% of their daylight hours, compared to 22% in Wilhelmina Bay, utilizing deep (280–450 m) foraging dives in addition to surface feeding strategies like bubble-netting. Selective foraging on larger krill by humpback whales has not been previously established, but suggests that whales may be sensitive to differences in individual prey quality.

The largest animals, extant rorqual whales, utilize intermittent engulfment filtration feeding (lunge feeding), which increases in efficiency with body size, enabling their gigantism.

We collected 437 h of bio-logging data from 23 Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) to test the relationship of feeding rates (λf) to body size. Here, we show that while ultra-high nighttime λf (mean ± s.d.: 165 ± 40 lunges h−1; max: 236 lunges h−1; mean depth: 28 ± 46 m) were indistinguishable from predictions from observations of larger species, daytime λf (mean depth: 72 ± 72 m) were only 25–40% of predicted rates. Both λf were near the maxima allowed by calculated biomechanical, physiological and environmental constraints, but these temporal constraints meant that maximum λf was below the expected λf for animals smaller than ~5 m—the length of weaned minke whales.

There were clear differences among the three species but all showed a distinct diurnal difference in diving behavior. While dive depth varied among animals based on where prey was located, whales spent a high proportion of their time closer to the surface where they would be more vulnerable to ship strikes at night than in the day. This was most pronounced for blue whales where vulnerability was twice as high at night compared to the day. We also found differences in movement patterns of whales between day and night. Movements were more localized to specific areas in the day near prey resources while at night these movements often involved directional movements (though sometimes returning to the same area). We show how in several specific areas like the Santa Barbara Channel, these differences in movements and locations translate to a very different overlap with shipping lanes at night compared to the daytime locations, which is the basis for most sighting data.","author":[{"family":"Calambokidis","given":"John"},{"family":"Fahlbusch","given":"James A."},{"family":"Szesciorka","given":"Angela R."},{"family":"Southall","given":"Brandon L."},{"family":"Cade","given":"Dave"},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari S."},{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Jeremy A."}],"citation-key":"calambokidis_etal19","container-title":"Frontiers in Marine Science","DOI":"10.3389/fmars.2019.00543","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,13]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2969926056","title":"Differential Vulnerability to Ship Strikes Between Day and Night for Blue, Fin, and Humpback Whales Based on Dive and Movement Data From Medium Duration Archival Tags","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"carey_goldbogen17","abstract":"In the dense aquatic environment, the most adept swimmers are streamlined to reduce drag and increase the efficiency of locomotion. However, because they open their mouth to wide gape angles to deploy their filtering apparatus, ram filter feeders apparently switch between diametrically opposite swimming modes: highly efficient, streamlined ‘beat–glide’ swimming, and ram filter feeding, which has been hypothesized to be a high-cost feeding mode because of presumed increased drag. Ram filter-feeding forage fish are thought to play an important role in the flux of nutrients and energy in upwelling ecosystems; however, the biomechanics and energetics of this feeding mechanism remain poorly understood. We quantified the kinematics of an iconic forage fish, the northern anchovy, Engraulis mordax, during ram filter feeding and non-feeding, mouth-closed beat–glide swimming. Although many kinematic parameters between the two swimming modes were similar, we found that swimming speeds and tailbeat frequencies were significantly lower during ram feeding. Rather than maintain speed with the school, a speed which closely matches theoretical optimum filter-feeding speeds was consistently observed. Beat–glide swimming was characterized by high variability in all kinematic parameters, but variance in kinematic parameters was much lower during ram filter feeding.

  {"id":"carroll_etal21","abstract":"Animal migrations track predictable seasonal patterns of resource availability and suitable thermal habitat. As climate change alters this ‘energy landscape’, some migratory species may struggle to adapt. We examined how climate variability influences movements, thermal habitat selection and energy intake by juvenile Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis) during seasonal foraging migrations in the California Current. We tracked 242 tuna across 15 years (2002–2016) with high-resolution archival tags, estimating their daily energy intake via abdominal warming associated with digestion (the ‘heat increment of feeding’). The poleward extent of foraging migrations was flexible in response to climate variability, allowing tuna to track poleward displacements of thermal habitat where their standard metabolic rates were minimized. During a marine heatwave that saw temperature anomalies of up to +2.5°C in the California Current, spatially explicit energy intake by tuna was approximately 15% lower than average. However, by shifting their mean seasonal migration approximately 900 km poleward, tuna remained in waters within their optimal temperature range and increased their energy intake. Our findings illustrate how tradeoffs between physiology and prey availability structure migration in a highly mobile vertebrate, and suggest that flexible migration strategies can buffer animals against energetic costs associated with climate variability and change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Carroll","given":"Gemma"},{"family":"Brodie","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Whitlock","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Ganong","given":"James"},{"family":"Bograd","given":"Steven J."},{"family":"Hazen","given":"Elliott"},{"family":"Block","given":"Barbara A."}],"citation-key":"carroll_etal21","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2021.0671","issue":"1956","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"page":"20210671","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Flexible use of a dynamic energy landscape buffers a marine predator against extreme climate variability","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2021.0671","volume":"288"},
  {"id":"carter_etal22","abstract":"Marine predator populations are crucial to the structure and functioning of ecosystems. Like many predator taxa, pinnipeds face an increasingly complex array of natural and anthropogenic threats. Understanding the relationship between at-sea processes and trends in abundance at land-based monitoring sites requires robust estimates of at-sea distribution, often on multi-region scales. Such an understanding is critical for effective conservation management, but estimates are often limited in spatial extent by spatial coverage of animal-borne tracking data. Grey (Halichoerus grypus) and harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) are sympatric predators in North Atlantic shelf seas. The United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland represents an important population centre for both species, and Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) are designated for their monitoring and protection. Here we use an extensive high-resolution GPS tracking dataset, unprecedented in both size (114 grey and 239 harbour seals) and spatial coverage, to model habitat preference and generate at-sea distribution estimates for the entire UK and Ireland populations of both species. We found regional differences in environmental drivers of distribution for both species which likely relate to regional variation in diet and population trends. Moreover, we provide SAC-specific estimates of at-sea distribution for use in marine spatial planning, demonstrating that hotspots of at-sea density in UK and Ireland-wide maps cannot always be apportioned to the nearest SAC. We show that for grey seals, colonial capital breeders, there is a mismatch between SACs (where impacts are likely to be detected) and areas where impacts are most likely to occur (at sea). We highlight an urgent need for further research to elucidate the links between at-sea distribution during the foraging season and population trends observed in SACs. More generally, we highlight that the potential for such a disconnect needs to be considered when designating and managing protected sites, particularly for species that aggregate to breed and exhibit partial migration (e.g. grey seals), or spatial variation in migration strategies. We demonstrate the use of strategic tracking efforts to predict distribution across multiple regions, but caution that such efforts should be mindful of the potential for differences in species-environment relationships despite similar accessible habitats.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Carter","given":"Matt I.

Their relative age was estimated based on the degree of unfurling of the dorsal fin, and analysis of their time budgets revealed that behavior changed as the calves matured. Among the youngest group of calves (n= 27), persistent travel accounted for median 85% (interquartile range 34%) of the calves' time budget, they spent little time alone at the surface and the breathing regime included frequent intermittent breaths. Within the oldest group of calves (n= 26), time spent traveling dropped to a median 47% (IQR 42%) of the time budget, they spent more time at rest, surfaced alone more frequently, and the breathing regime more closely resembled that of adult humpbacks.

  {"id":"castellote_etal12","abstract":"Non-lethal behavioural effects of underwater noise in marine mammals are difficult to measure. Here we report acoustic and behavioural changes by fin whales in response to two different types of anthropogenic noise: shipping and airgun noise. Acoustic features of fin whale 20-Hz song notes recorded in the Mediterranean Sea and Northeast Atlantic Ocean were compared for areas with different shipping noise levels, different traffic intensities in the Strait of Gibraltar and during a seismic airgun array survey. In high noise conditions 20-Hz note duration shortened, bandwidth decreased, centre frequency decreased and peak frequency decreased. Similar results were obtained in 20-Hz song notes recorded during a 10-day seismic survey. During the first 72h of the survey, a steady decrease in song received levels and bearings to singers indicated that whales moved away from the airgun array source and out of our detection area, and this displacement persisted for a time period well beyond the 10-day duration of seismic airgun activity. This study provides evidence that male fin whales from two different subpopulations modify song characteristics under increased background noise conditions, and that under seismic airgun activity conditions they leave an area for an extended period. We hypothesize that fin whale acoustic communication is modified to compensate for increased background noise and that a sensitization process may play a role in the observed temporary displacement. The observed acoustic and behavioural changes of this endangered species are discussed in the context of reproduction success and population survival.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Castellote","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Clark","given":"Christopher W."},{"family":"Lammers","given":"Marc O."}],"citation-key":"castellote_etal12","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2011.12.021","ISSN":"0006-3207","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","page":"115-122","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Acoustic and behavioural changes by fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) in response to shipping and airgun noise","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320711004848","volume":"147"},
  {"id":"castrillon_bengtsonnash20","abstract":"The ability to accurately gauge the body condition of free-swimming cetaceans is invaluable in population and conservation biology, due to the direct implications that this measure has on individual fitness, survival, and reproductive success. Furthermore, monitoring temporal change in body condition offers insight into foraging success over time, and therefore the health of the supporting ecosystem, as well as a species’ resilience. These parameters are particularly relevant in the context of widespread and accelerated, climate-induced habitat change. There are, however, significant logistical challenges involved with research and monitoring of large cetaceans, which often preclude direct measure of body condition of live individuals. Consequently, a wide variety of indirect approaches, or proxies, for estimating energetic stores have been proposed over past decades. To date, no single, standardized, approach has been shown to serve as a robust estimation of body condition across species, age categories, and in both live and dead individuals. Nonetheless, it is clear that streamlining and advancing body condition measures would carry significant benefits for diverse areas of cetacean research and management. Here, we review traditional approaches and new applications for the evaluation of cetacean energetic reserves. Specific attention is given to the criteria of measure performance (sensitivity and accuracy), level of invasiveness, cost and effort required for implementation, as well as versatility e.g. applicability across different species, age groups, as well as living versus deceased animals. Measures have been benchmarked against these criteria in an effort to identify key candidates for further development, and key research priorities in the field.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Castrillon","given":"Juliana"},{"family":"Bengtson Nash","given":"Susan"}],"citation-key":"castrillon_bengtsonnash20","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.6301","ISSN":"2045-7758","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","page":"6144-6162","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Evaluating cetacean body condition; a review of traditional approaches and new developments","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.6301","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"catarinat_fonseca_etal22","abstract":"Efficient use of the energy budget is of fundamental importance for long-distance migrants, which must cope with seasonal energy demands and environmental conditions. Time-activity budgets can provide information on how animals balance energy use and acquisition over their annual cycle, and on the costs and benefits of different migratory strategies. Baleen whales, such as the fin whale, perform long migrations between feeding and breeding grounds. Although there are now a handful of studies describing the diving and foraging behavior of fin whales, most were carried out at their high-latitude foraging grounds, and very little is known about their behavior in wintering habitats or during migration. We analyzed time-depth recorder data to describe the diving behavior and activity patterns of fin whales in a migratory habitat. Using a hierarchical cluster analysis based on a set of dive variables, we identified six dive types. Four of these dive types (shallow exploratory, shallow active, deep exploratory and deep active) were likely associated to foraging. The other two comprised long non-active dives and dives of variable shape, which may represent resting, traveling or even vocalizing behavior. Shallow exploratory dives were the most frequent dive type (23%) and shallow active were the least frequent (5%). The two deepest dive types, deep active and exploratory, were predominantly carried out during the day, and night dives were significantly shallower than daylight dives, suggesting that fin whales tracked the vertical migration of prey. Whales spent 60% of their dive time engaged in dives associated with feeding and/or prey searching, suggesting they prioritized energy intake over energy conservation. Finally, we found that whales spent more time at or close (&amp;lt;15 m depth) to the surface at night (73%) than during the day (55%), indicating a higher vulnerability to ship strikes during this period. Our study provides novel information on the behavioral patterns and time-activity budgets of fin whales in a migratory habitat. This information is essential for bioenergetic analyses and to predict how fin whales respond to human activities and ongoing environmental changes.","author":[{"literal":"Catarina T.

A multivariate multiple linear regression (MMLR) framework is used to predict the measured ambient noise, modeled as a multivariate acoustic response, from SES (depth, speed, and acceleration) and environmental (wind) variables. Results show that the acoustic contributions of SES variables affect mainly low-frequency sound pressure levels (SPLs), while frequency bands above 3 kHz are less corrupted by SES displacement and allow a good measure of the Indian Ocean soundscape. Also, preliminary results toward the development of a mobile embedded weather sensor are presented.

  {"id":"chenoweth_etal21","abstract":"The relative energetic benefits of foraging on one type of prey rather than another are not easily measured, particularly for large free-ranging predators. Nonetheless, assumptions about preferred and alternative prey are frequently made when predicting how a predator may impact its environment, adapt to environmental change or interact with human activities. We developed and implemented a process-based model to investigate the potential energetic benefit (PEB) of in situ foraging opportunities in rorqual whales. The model integrates and evaluates the energetic importance of measured prey patch characteristics (prey distribution, energy content and predator avoidance) and predator characteristics (morphometrics, foraging tactics and feeding rates). We applied the model to test the assumption that hatchery-released juvenile salmon are an ‘easy meal’ for humpback whales compared to more common prey: herring and krill. In 11 out of the 13 foraging situations considered, whales were found to be feeding in a manner where net energy gain was greater than the energetic costs of non-foraging swimming. Humpback whale PEB for hatchery-released juvenile salmon fell within the range of the PEB for krill and herring but varied by species, from relatively high PEB for chum salmon to relatively low for coho salmon. Our model provides behavioural insight as well, indicating that shallow feeding may be more important for reducing energy expenditure through slower lunge speeds than for increasing prey capture. The model also provides a means of identifying prey patch characteristics, with prey aggregation playing the largest role in determining PEB despite being a poor overall proxy for PEB, supporting the use of the complex model framework. Modelling approaches are especially valuable where they can use reasonable assumptions to substitute for lack of reliable observations, thereby integrating a range of interacting factors into a single framework. Additionally, because process-based models can be used to make predictions outside the range of previously observed conditions, they will be increasingly useful in a changing climate.

  {"id":"chimienti_etal20","abstract":"Dynamic energy budget individual-based models (DEB-IBMs) provide a well-tested framework for modelling the acquisition and use of energy throughout the life cycle of organisms. These models are often developed using species-specific data to link behaviour and physiology and predict how individuals and populations perform in changing environments. Novel bio-logging technology, applied to free-ranging animals, provide detailed information about individual behavioural variations and responses to the environment. However, so far, no DEB-IBM has attempted to link and parameterise energy dynamics with the fine-scale activity data obtained by bio-logging to answer questions related to life history events in wild populations. The aim of this study is, therefore, to develop and test a DEB-IBM framework which integrates individuals behaviour obtained from high-resolution activity data. Our approach uses data collected with GPS and accelerometer tags attached to two muskox (Ovibos moschatus). The individuals had different fates: one survived the Arctic winter, while the other died. Applying hidden Markov models to accelerometer data, we quantified the variation in behavioural activity budgets (in stationary, feeding and transit) in relation to environmental conditions. We subsequently test how differences in time allocation affect fitness outcomes such as body mass, energy reserves and survival. The proportion of time spent feeding by each animal is used within the DEB-IBM framework to scale the functional response for food acquisition. Simulations using the seasonal feeding budget of the deceased individual lead to drastically reduced energy reserves and body weight during the Arctic winter, and to elevated probabilities of mortality by the end of winter. In contrast, simulations using the seasonal feeding pattern of the surviving muskox, result in much less pronounced losses in reserves and body weight, leading to negligible over-winter mortality. The framework we present here uses standardized modelling techniques, is applicable across species and can easily be extended to include other fitness measures or environmental stressors. Moreover, our framework provides the foundation needed for future studies to link individual movements, energetic processes, life history events and population dynamics in wildlife, which would open up possibilities to test how changing (future) environmental conditions influence animal decision-making and ultimately population level consequences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Chimienti","given":"Marianna"},{"family":"Desforges","given":"Jean-Pierre"},{"family":"Beumer","given":"Larissa T."},{"family":"Nabe-Nielsen","given":"Jacob"},{"family":"Beest","given":"Floris M.","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Niels Martin"}],"citation-key":"chimienti_etal20","container-title":"Ecological Modelling","container-title-short":"Ecological Modelling","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.109250","ISSN":"0304-3800","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","page":"109250","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Energetics as common currency for integrating high resolution activity patterns into dynamic energy budget-individual based models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380020303203","volume":"434"},

This small and genetically isolated population is Endangered and extremely vulnerable to anthropogenic threats. While fisheries and shipping have been identified as possible direct threats to the population, non-lethal effects resulting from potential fishing gear entanglement, low prey availability and disease, have the likelihood to negatively affect survival and reproduction by reducing the body condition of whales. We assessed the body condition (residual of body volume against body length) of Oman’s ASHW population by comparing it to a healthy (growing) population of humpback whales of Western Australia (breeding stock D). Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV or drone) photogrammetry methods were used to measure the body condition of ASHWs (n=9) in November 2019, and breeding stock D humpback whales of South-western Australia early (June, n=56) and late (October, n=111) in the 2017 breeding season. The body lengths of the sampled ASHWs ranged from 11.8 to 14.2 m, which means that all the sampled whales were adults. The body condition of ASHWs (mean=7.2%, SE=3.28, n=9) were similar to that of similarly-sized (11.2-15.3 m body length) breeding stock D adults at the beginning of the breeding season (mean=8.6%, SE=3.98, n=19), but significantly higher than stock D humpback whales at the end of the season (mean=3.4%, SE=3.57, n=48). This suggests that whales sampled in the study were not nutritionally supressed. Three of the ASHWs were identified as females, with their body condition (mean=12.5%, SE=6.10, n=3) being similar to that of early lactating females (mean=5.5%, SE=6.39, n=31) from the migratory stock D population. However, to determine the link between body condition and reproduction, additional sampling of ASHWs is needed to determine inter- and intra-seasonal variations in body condition. Continued research into the health of the ASHW population, together with continued monitoring of population demographics and assessment of fisheries interactions is therefore needed.","author":[{"family":"Christiansen","given":"F"},{"family":"Baldwin","given":"R"},{"family":"Minton","given":"G"},{"family":"Collins","given":"T"},{"family":"Sprogis","given":"K"},{"family":"Rudd","given":"J"},{"family":"Harthi","given":"S Al"},{"family":"Leslie","given":"M"},{"family":"MacDonald","given":"D"},{"family":"Willson","given":"A"}],"citation-key":"christiansen_etal","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Assessing the body condition of the world’s only non-migratory humpback whale population, the endangered Arabian Sea humpback whale","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"christiansen_etal13","abstract":"Seasonal trends in energy storage of the minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), a capital breeder, were investigated in Iceland, a North Atlantic feeding ground. The aim was to better understand the energy acquisition strategies of minke whales and the energetic costs that different reproductive classes face during the breeding season. We modelled total blubber volume, using blubber thickness and morphometric measurements of individual whales. Blubber volume was influenced by body length, and was higher for pregnant females than mature whales. Blubber volume increased linearly through the feeding season at the same rate for mature (mean ± s.e.m.=0.0028±0.00103m3day−1; N=61 male, 5 female) and pregnant whales (0.0024±0.00100m3day−1; N=49), suggesting that minke whales aim to maximise energy storage while on the feeding grounds. The total amount of blubber accumulated over the feeding season (0.51±0.119m3 for mature and 0.43±0.112m3 for pregnant whales), together with energy stored as muscle and intra-abdominal fats, constitutes the total amount of energy available for reproduction (fetus development and lactation) on the breeding grounds, as well as migration, daily field metabolic rates, growth and body maintenance. No seasonal variation was observed for immature whales (N=4 male, 12 female), suggesting that they are investing most of their excess energy into growth rather than reproduction, in order to reach the length of sexual maturity faster and start reproducing earlier. Our novel modelling approach provides insight into large whale bioenergetics and life history strategies, as well as the relationship between single-site measurement of blubber thickness and total blubber volume.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Christiansen","given":"Fredrik"},{"family":"Víkingsson","given":"Gísli A."},{"family":"Rasmussen","given":"Marianne H."},{"family":"Lusseau","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"christiansen_etal13","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Biology","DOI":"10.1242/jeb.074518","ISSN":"1477-9145, 0022-0949","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","page":"427-436","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Minke whales maximise energy storage on their feeding grounds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/216/3/427/11948/Minke-whales-maximise-energy-storage-on-their","volume":"216"},

FBC was modelled as the relative difference between measured blubber volume and the average expected blubber volume of individual whales. Generalized linear models were used to test the effect of FBC on foetus length, while accounting for the daily growth in foetus size through gestation, as well as other covariates. Foetus length increased curvilinearly through the study period at an average rate of 0·964 cm day−1 (SE = 0·138). The effect of FBC on foetal length was nonlinear, showing an almost linear positive relationship for females in poorer body condition (FBC < 0), which levelled off at better body conditions (FBC > 0). The curvilinear relationship between FBC and foetus growth was confirmed by fitting a generalized additive model and by running separate analyses on two subsets of data separating females in poorer and better condition. Our findings suggest that females that are in poorer body condition reduce their energetic investment in their foetus proportionately to their condition, most likely to help maintain a high survival probability. That foetus length did not increase for females in better body condition suggests that females have an upper limit on the amount of energy they will or can invest in their foetus. Reducing the size at birth by reducing the gestation period is also unlikely, because the reproductive cycle of balaenopterids is strongly linked to their seasonal migration between feeding grounds and breeding grounds. This study is the first to demonstrate that FBC can affect foetus growth in a capital breeding mysticete.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Christiansen","given":"Fredrik"},{"family":"Víkingsson","given":"Gísli A."},{"family":"Rasmussen","given":"Marianne H."},{"family":"Lusseau","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"christiansen_etal14","container-title":"Functional Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2435.12200","ISSN":"1365-2435","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","page":"579-588","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Female body condition affects foetal growth in a capital breeding mysticete","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2435.12200","volume":"28"},

Despite exhibiting some of the fastest offspring growth rates among mammals, the cost of reproduction in baleen whales is largely unknown since standard field metabolic techniques cannot be applied. We quantified the cost of reproduction for southern right whales Eubalaena australis over a 3 mo breeding season. We did this by determining the relationship between calf growth rate and maternal rate of loss in energy reserves, using repeated measurements of body volume obtained from un manned aerial vehicle photogrammetry. We recorded 1118 body volume estimates from 40 female and calf pairs over 40 to 89 d. Calves grew at a rate of 3.2 cm d−1 (SD = 0.45) in body length and 0.081 m³ d−1 (SD = 0.011) in body volume, while females decreased in volume at a rate of 0.126 m³ d−1 (SD = 0.036). The average volume conversion efficiency from female to calf was 68% (SD = 16.91). Calf growth rate was positively related to the rate of loss in maternal body volume, suggesting that maternal volume loss is proportional to the energy investment into her calf. Maternal in vestment was determined by her body size and condition, with longer and more rotund females investing more volume into their calves compared to shorter and leaner females. Lactating females lost on average 25% of their initial body volume over the 3 mo breeding season. This study demonstrates the considerable energetic cost that females face during the lactation period, and highlights the importance of sufficient maternal energy reserves for reproduction in this capital breeding species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Christiansen","given":"Fredrik"},{"family":"Vivier","given":"Fabien"},{"family":"Charlton","given":"Claire"},{"family":"Ward","given":"Rhianne"},{"family":"Amerson","given":"Alicia"},{"family":"Burnell","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Bejder","given":"Lars"}],"citation-key":"christiansen_etal18","container-title":"Marine Ecology Progress Series","ISSN":"0171-8630","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"page":"267-281","publisher":"Inter-Research Science Center","source":"JSTOR","title":"Maternal body size and condition determine calf growth rates in southern right whales","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26502972","volume":"592"},
  {"id":"christiansen_etal19","abstract":"Body mass is a key life-history trait in animals. Despite being the largest animals on the planet, no method currently exists to estimate body mass of free-living whales. We combined aerial photographs and historical catch records to estimate the body mass of free-living right whales (Eubalaena sp.). First, aerial photogrammetry from unmanned aerial vehicles was used to measure the body length, width (lateral distance) and height (dorso-ventral distance) of free-living southern right whales (Eubalaena australis; 48 calves, seven juveniles and 31 lactating females). From these data, body volume was estimated by modelling the whales as a series of infinitely small ellipses. The body girth of the whales was next calculated at three measurement sites (across the pectoral fin, the umbilicus and the anus) and a linear model was developed to predict body volume from the body girth and length data. To obtain a volume-to-mass conversion factor, this model was then used to estimate the body volume of eight lethally caught North Pacific right whales (Eubalaena japonica), for which body mass was measured. This conversion factor was consequently used to predict the body mass of the free-living whales. The cross-sectional body shape (height–width ratio) of the whales was slightly flattened dorso-ventrally at the anterior end of the body, almost circular in the mid region, and significantly flattened in the lateral plane across the posterior half of the body. Compared to a circular cross-sectional model, our body mass model incorporating body length, width and height improved mass estimates by up to 23.6% (mean = 6.1%, SD = 5.27). Our model had a mean error of only 1.6% (SD = 0.012), compared to 9.5% (SD = 7.68) for a simpler body length-to-mass model. The volume-to-mass conversion factor was estimated at 754.63 kg/m3 (SD = 50.03). Predicted body mass estimates were within a close range of existing body mass measurements. We provide a non-invasive method to accurately estimate body mass of free-living whales while accounting for both their structural size (body length) and relative body condition (body width). Our approach can be directly applied to other marine mammals by adjusting the model parameters (body mass model script provided).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Christiansen","given":"Fredrik"},{"family":"Sironi","given":"Mariano"},{"family":"Moore","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Martino","given":"Matías Di"},{"family":"Ricciardi","given":"Marcos"},{"family":"Warick","given":"Hunter A."},{"family":"Irschick","given":"Duncan J."},{"family":"Gutierrez","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Uhart","given":"Marcela M."}],"citation-key":"christiansen_etal19","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.13298","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"2034-2044","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Estimating body mass of free-living whales using aerial photogrammetry and 3D volumetrics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.13298","volume":"10"},

A Richards length-at-age growth model was developed, based on 161 calves, 20 yearlings, 1 juvenile and 23 adults, ranging in age from newborn to 27 yr. Predicted lengths were 4.7 m at birth, 12.5 m at minimum age of first parturition (6 yr) and an asymptotic length of 14.3 m. A volume-at-age curve was estimated from the body volume versus length relationship, and converted to a mass-at-age curve, using data on body tissue composition of North Pacific right whales E. japonica (n = 13). The energetic cost of growth was estimated using published estimates of tissue lipid and protein concentrations. The cost of growth for SRWs (in MJ d−1) was 2112 at birth, 544 at 4 mo, 314 at 1 yr (~weaning age), 108 at 5 yr (minimum age of sexual maturity), 51.5 at 10 yr and 5.2 at 30 yr.

  {"id":"christiansen_etal22a","abstract":"The cost of reproduction greatly affects a species’ life history strategy. Baleen whales exhibit some of the fastest offspring growth rates in the animal kingdom. We quantified the energetic cost of gestation for southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) by combining whaling catch records of pregnant females with photogrammetry data on southern right whale mothers and calves from two breeding grounds in Argentina and Australia. The relationship between calf birth size and maternal length was determined from repeated measurements of individual females before and after giving birth. Fetal growth was determined from generalized linear models fitted to fetal length data from whaling operations between 1961 and 1967. Fetal length was converted to volume and mass, using the volume-to-length relationship of newborn southern right whales calves, and published tissue composition and energy content estimates. Fetal maintenance costs (heat of gestation) and the energy content of the placenta were predicted from published relationships and added to the fetal growth cost to calculate the total cost of gestation. Our findings showed that fetal growth rates and birth size increased linearly with maternal length, with calves being born at ∼35% maternal length. Fetal length increased curvilinearly through gestation, which resulted in an exponential increase in fetal volume and mass. Consequently, the cost of gestation was very low during the first (0.1% of total cost) and second trimester (4.9%), but increased rapidly during the last trimester (95.0%). The heat of gestation incurred the highest cost for pregnant females (73.8%), followed by fetal growth (21.2%) and the placental energy content (5.0%). Key points Baleen whales exhibit some of the fastest fetal growth rates in the animal kingdom. Despite this, the energetic cost of gestation is largely unknown, as well as the influence of maternal body size on fetal growth rates and calf birth sizes. We combined historical whaling records and drone photogrammetry data to determine fetal growth rates and birth sizes in southern right whales (Eubalaena australis), from which we estimated the cost of gestation. Calf birth size, and consequent fetal growth rates, increased positively with maternal body size. The cost of gestation was negligible for southern right whale females during the first two trimesters, but increased rapidly during the last trimester. These results show that late gestation incurs a significant cost for baleen whale females, and needs to be accounted for in bioenergetic models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Christiansen","given":"Fredrik"},{"family":"Uhart","given":"Marcela M"},{"family":"Bejder","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Clapham","given":"Phil"},{"family":"Ivashchenko","given":"Yulia"},{"family":"Tormosov","given":"Dmitry"},{"family":"Lewin","given":"Nicolás"},{"family":"Sironi","given":"Mariano"}],"citation-key":"christiansen_etal22a","container-title":"The Journal of Physiology","DOI":"10.1113/JP282351","ISSN":"1469-7793","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"language":"en","page":"2245-2266","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Fetal growth, birth size and energetic cost of gestation in southern right whales","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1113/JP282351","volume":"600"},
  {"id":"christiansen_etal23","abstract":"Quantifying the energy expenditure of animals is critical to understand the cost of anthropogenic disturbance relative to their overall energy requirements. We used novel drone focal follows (776 follows, 185 individuals) and aerial photogrammetry (5,372 measurements, 791 individuals) to measure the respiration rate and body condition loss of southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) on a breeding ground in Australia. Respiration rates were converted to oxygen consumption and field metabolic rates (FMR) using published bioenergetic models. The intra-seasonal loss in body condition of different reproductive classes (calves, juveniles, adults, pregnant and lactating) was converted to blubber energy loss and total energy expenditure (TEE). Using these two metrics, we tested the effects of body size, reproductive state and activity level on right whale energy expenditure. Respiration rates and mass-specific FMR decreased exponentially with an increase in body size, as expected based on allometric scaling. FMR increased curvilinearly with an increase in swim speed, likely as a result of increased drag and increased locomotion costs. Respiration rates and FMR were 44% higher for pregnant and lactating females compared to adults, suggesting significant costs of foetal maintenance and milk production, respectively. The estimated FMR of adults based on their respiration rates, corresponded well with the estimated TEE based on body condition loss. The rate of decline in body condition of pregnant and lactating females was considerably higher than expected based on respiration rates, which likely reflects the milk energy transfer from mothers to calves, which is not reflected in their FMR.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Christiansen","given":"Fredrik"},{"family":"Sprogis","given":"Kate R."},{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Mia L.

  {"id":"clarke_johnston99","abstract":"1. We examined published studies relating resting oxygen consumption to body mass and temperature in post-larval teleost fish. The resulting database comprised 138 studies of 69 species (representing 28 families and 12 orders) living over a temperature range of c. 40 °C. 2. Resting metabolic rate (Rb; mmol oxygen gas h–1) was related to body mass (M; wet mass, g) by Rb = aMb, where a is a constant and b the scaling exponent. The model was fitted by least squares linear regression after logarithmic transformation of both variables. The mean value of scaling exponent, b, for the 69 individual species was 0·79 (SE 0·11). The general equation for all teleost fish was 1nRb = 0·80(1nM) – 5·43. 3. The relationship between resting oxygen consumption and environmental temperature for a 50-g fish was curvilinear. A typical tropical fish at 30°C requires approximately six times as much oxygen for resting metabolism as does a polar fish at 0°C. This relationship could be fitted by several statistical models, of which the Arrhenius model is probably the most appropriate. The Arrhenius model for the resting metabolism of 69 species of teleost fish, corrected to a standard body mass of 50 g, was 1nRb = 15·7 – 5·02.T–1, where T is absolute temperature (103 × K). 4. The Arrhenius model fitted to all 69 species exhibited a lower thermal sensitivity of resting metabolism (mean Q10 = 1·83 over the range 0–30 °C) than typical within-species acclimation studies (median Q10 = 2·40, n = 14). This suggests that evolutionary adaptation has reduced the overall thermal sensitivity of resting metabolism across species. Analysis of covariance indicated that the relationships between resting metabolic rate and temperature for various taxa (orders) showed similar slopes but significantly different mean rates. 5. Analysis of the data for perciform fish provided no support for metabolic cold adaptation (the hypothesis that polar fish show a resting metabolic rate higher than predicted from the overall rate/temperature relationship established for temperate and tropical species). 6. Taxonomic variation in mean resting metabolic rate showed no relationship to phylogeny, although the robustness of this conclusion is constrained by our limited knowledge of fish evolutionary history.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Clarke","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Johnston","given":"Nadine M."}],"citation-key":"clarke_johnston99","container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.1046/j.1365-2656.1999.00337.x","ISSN":"1365-2656","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999]]},"language":"en","page":"893-905","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Scaling of metabolic rate with body mass and temperature in teleost fish","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2656.1999.00337.x","volume":"68"},

  {"id":"clauss_etal03","abstract":"An oft-cited nutritional advantage of large body size is that larger animals have lower relative energy requirements and that, due to their increased gastrointestinal tract (GIT) capacity, they achieve longer ingesta passage rates, which allows them to use forage of lower quality. However, the fermentation of plant material cannot be optimized endlessly; there is a time when plant fibre is totally fermented, and another when energy losses due to methanogenic bacteria become punitive. Therefore, very large herbivores would need to evolve adaptations for a comparative acceleration of ingesta passage. To our knowledge, this phenomenon has not been emphasized in the literature to date. We propose that, among the extant herbivores, elephants, with their comparatively fast passage rate and low digestibility coefficients, are indicators of a trend that allowed even larger hindgut fermenting mammals to exist. The limited existing anatomical data on large hindgut fermenters suggests that both a relative shortening of the GIT, an increase in GIT diameter, and a reduced caecum might contribute to relatively faster ingesta passage; however, more anatomical data is needed to verify these hypotheses. The digestive physiology of large foregut fermenters presents a unique problem: ruminant—and nonruminant—forestomachs were designed to delay ingesta passage, and they limit food intake as a side effect. Therefore, with increasing body size and increasing absolute energy requirements, their relative capacity has to increase in order to compensate for this intake limitation. It seems that the foregut fermenting ungulates did not evolve species in which the intake-limiting effect of the foregut could be reduced, e.g. by special bypass structures, and hence this digestive model imposed an intrinsic body size limit. This limit will be lower the more the natural diet enhances the ingesta retention and hence the intake-limiting effect. Therefore, due to the mechanical characteristics of grass, grazing ruminants cannot become as big as the largest browsing ruminant. Ruminants are not absent from the very large body size classes because their digestive physiology offers no particular advantage, but because their digestive physiology itself intrinsically imposes a body size limit. We suggest that the decreasing ability for colonic water absorption in large grazing ruminants and the largest extant foregut fermenter, the hippopotamus, are an indication of this limit, and are the outcome of the competition of organs for the available space within the abdominal cavity. Our hypotheses are supported by the fossil record on extinct ruminant/tylopod species which did not, with the possible exception of the Sivatheriinae, surpass extant species in maximum body size. In contrast to foregut fermentation, the GIT design of hindgut fermenters allows adaptations for relative passage acceleration, which explains why very large extinct mammalian herbivores are thought to have been hindgut fermenters.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Clauss","given":"M."},{"family":"Frey","given":"R."},{"family":"Kiefer","given":"B."},{"family":"Lechner-Doll","given":"M."},{"family":"Loehlein","given":"W."},{"family":"Polster","given":"C."},{"family":"Rössner","given":"G.

In other species, circovirus infection may cause mortality or opportunistic co-infection by other pathogens. We report on a targeted surveillance of stranded cetaceans in the Pacific basin, including archived beaked whale species, strandings where pathological findings suggested disease presence, mass stranded animals, and additional individuals to represent a broad range of Hawaiian cetacean species. Archived tissues primarily from the brain, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, and lymph nodes of individuals stranded between 2000 and 2020 (n=30) were tested by PCR for the presence of BWCV. Suspect positive tissue amplicons were confirmed as BWCV through sequencing. Of the screened individuals, 15 animals tested positive in one or more tissues, with a single striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) testing positive in all six tissues. The highest rate of detection among positive cases was found in the brain (69%), followed by lymph (67%) and lung tissues (64%). Additionally, co-infections of cetacean morbillivirus (n=3), Brucella ceti (n=1), and Toxoplasma gondii (n=1) were found among the positive cases. These results expand the potential host range for BWCV into ten additional odontocete species. New host species include a dwarf sperm whale (Kogia sima) that stranded on O‘ahu in 2000, predating the initial case of BWCV. The results broaden the known geographic range of BWCV to Saipan in the Western Pacific, and American Samoa in the South Pacific, where stranded Cuvier’s beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris) tested positive. Although the clinical significance is currently unknown, this study demonstrates that BWCV has a high prevalence within targeted cetacean screening efforts. Infectious diseases pose a major threat to cetaceans and BWCV may represent an important emerging disease within populations spanning the central, Western, and South Pacific.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Clifton","given":"Cody W."},{"family":"Silva-Krott","given":"Ilse"},{"family":"Marsik","given":"Michael G."},{"family":"West","given":"Kristi L."}],"citation-key":"clifton_etal23","container-title":"Frontiers in Marine Science","ISSN":"2296-7745","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Targeted surveillance detected novel beaked whale circovirus in ten new host cetacean species across the Pacific basin","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.945289","volume":"9"},

In c. 90% of the feeding links among the animal species with known sizes, a larger predator consumes a smaller prey. 2. Larger predators eat prey with a wider range of body sizes than do smaller predators. The geometric mean predator size increases with the size of prey. The increase in geometric mean predator size is less than proportional to the increase in prey size (i.e. has a slope less than 1 on log-log coordinates). 3. The geometric mean sizes of prey and predators increase as the habitat of webs changes from aquatic to terrestrial to coastal to marine. Within each type of habitat, mean prey sizes are always less than mean predator sizes, and prey and predator sizes are always positively correlated. 4. Feeding relations order the metabolic types of organisms from invertebrate to vertebrate ectotherm to vertebrate endotherm. Organisms commonly eat other organisms with the same or lower metabolic type, but (with very rare exceptions) organisms do not eat other organisms with a higher metabolic type. Mean sizes of prey increase as the metabolic type of prey changes from invertebrate to vertebrate ectotherm to vertebrate endotherm, but the same does not hold true for predators. 5. Prey and predator sizes are positively correlated in links from invertebrate prey to invertebrate predators. In links with other combinations of prey and predator metabolic types, the correlation between prey and predator body sizes is rarely large when it is positive, and in some cases is even negative. 6. Species sizes are roughly log-normally distributed. 7. Body size offers a good (though not perfect) interpretation of the ordering of animal species assumed in the cascade model, a stochastic model of food web structure. When body size is taken as the physical interpretation of the ordering assumed in the cascade model, and when the body sizes of different animal species are taken as log-normally distributed, many of the empirical findings can be explained in terms of the cascade model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Cohen","given":"Joel E."},{"family":"Pimm","given":"Stuart L."},{"family":"Yodzis","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Saldaña","given":"Joan"}],"citation-key":"cohen_etal93","container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.2307/5483","ISSN":"0021-8790","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1993]]},"page":"67-78","publisher":"[Wiley, British Ecological Society]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Body Sizes of Animal Predators and Animal Prey in Food Webs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/5483","volume":"62"},

These whales have narrow and elongated flippers that are small relative to body size compared to related species such as right and gray whales. No experimental studies have addressed the hydrodynamic properties of minke whale flippers and their functional role during feeding maneuvers. This study integrated wind tunnel, locomotion and anatomical range of motion data to identify functional parameters of the cambered minke whale flipper. A full-sized cast of a minke whale flipper was used in wind tunnel testing of lift, drag and stall behavior at six speeds, corresponding to swimming speeds of 0.7–8.9 m s–1. Flow over the model surface stalled between 10° and 14° angle of attack (α) depending on testing speed. When the leading edge was rotated ventrally, loss in lift occurred around –18° α regardless of speed. Range of mobility in the fresh limb was approximately 40% greater than the range of positive lift-generating angles of attack predicted by wind tunnel data (+14°α). Video footage, photographs and observations of swimming, engulfment feeding and gulping minke whales showed limb positions corresponding to low drag in wind tunnel tests, and were therefore hydrodynamically efficient. Flippers play an important role in orienting the body during feeding maneuvers as they maintain trim of the body, an action that counters drag-induced torque of the body during water and prey intake.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Cooper","given":"Lisa Noelle"},{"family":"Sedano","given":"Nils"},{"family":"Johansson","given":"Stig"},{"family":"May","given":"Bryan"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Joey D."},{"family":"Holliday","given":"Casey M."},{"family":"Kot","given":"Brian W."},{"family":"Fish","given":"Frank E."}],"citation-key":"cooper_etal08","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Biology","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Biology","DOI":"10.1242/jeb.014134","ISSN":"0022-0949","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"page":"1859-1867","source":"Silverchair","title":"Hydrodynamic performance of the minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) flipper","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.014134","volume":"211"},

Some hypotheses offered to explain whale migration focus on direct benefits to the calf (thermoregulation, calm water) and some do not (resource tracking, and the “evolutionary holdover” hypothesis). Here, we suggest that a major selective advantage to migrating pregnant female baleen whales is a reduced risk of killer whale (Orcinus orca) predation on their newborn calves in low-latitude waters. Killer whale abundance in high latitudes is substantially greater than that in lower latitudes, and most killer whales do not appear to migrate with baleen whales. We suggest that the distribution of killer whales is determined more by their primary marine mammal prey, pinnipeds, and that following the baleen whale migrations would remove them from their pinniped prey. There are problems with all current hypotheses, most of which stem from a lack of directed research.

  {"id":"cotten_etal08","abstract":"Most mammals possess stamina because their locomotor and respiratory (i.e., ventilatory) systems are mechanically coupled. These systems are decoupled, however, in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) as they swim on a breath hold. Locomotion and ventilation are coupled only during their brief surfacing event, when they respire explosively (up to 90% of total lung volume in approximately 0.3 s) (Ridgway et al. [1969] Science 166:1651–1654). The predominantly slow-twitch ﬁber proﬁle of their diaphragm (Dearolf [2003] J Morphol 256:79–88) suggests that this muscle does not likely power their rapid ventilatory event. Based on Bramble’s ([1989] Amer Zool 29:171–186) biomechanical model of locomotor-respiratory coupling in galloping mammals, it was hypothesized that locomotor muscles function to power ventilation in bottlenose dolphins. It was further hypothesized that these muscles would be composed predominantly of fast-twitch ﬁbers to facilitate the bottlenose dolphin’s rapid ventilation. The gross morphology of craniocervical (scalenus, sternocephalicus, sternohyoid), thoracic (intercostals, transverse thoracis), and lumbopelvic (hypaxialis, rectus abdominis, abdominal obliques) muscles (n 5 7) and the ﬁber-type proﬁles (n 5 6) of selected muscles (scalenus, sternocephalicus, sternohyoid, rectus abdominis) of bottlenose dolphins were investigated. Physical manipulations of excised thoracic units were carried out to investigate potential actions of these muscles. Results suggest that the craniocervical muscles act to draw the sternum and associated ribs craniodorsally, which ﬂares the ribs laterally, and increases the thoracic cavity volume required for inspiration. The lumbopelvic muscles act to draw the sternum and caudal ribs caudally, which decreases the volumes of the thoracic and abdominal cavities required for expiration. All muscles investigated were composed predominantly of fast-twitch ﬁbers (range 61–88% by area) and appear histochemically poised for rapid contraction. These combined results suggest that dolphins utilize muscles, similar to those used by galloping mammals, to power their explosive ventilation. J. Morphol. 269:1520–1538, 2008.

Synthetic audiograms were generated for a fin whale by applying finite element modeling tools to X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans. We CT scanned the head of a small fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) in a scanner designed for solid-fuel rocket motors. Our computer (finite element) modeling toolkit allowed us to visualize what occurs when sounds interact with the anatomic geometry of the whale’s head. Simulations reveal two mechanisms that excite both bony ear complexes, (1) the skull-vibration enabled bone conduction mechanism and (2) a pressure mechanism transmitted through soft tissues. Bone conduction is the predominant mechanism. The mass density of the bony ear complexes and their firmly embedded attachments to the skull are universal across the Mysticeti, suggesting that sound reception mechanisms are similar in all baleen whales. Interactions between incident sound waves and the skull cause deformations that induce motion in each bony ear complex, resulting in best hearing sensitivity for low-frequency sounds. This predominant low-frequency sensitivity has significant implications for assessing mysticete exposure levels to anthropogenic sounds. The din of man-made ocean noise has increased steadily over the past half century. Our results provide valuable data for U.S. regulatory agencies and concerned large-scale industrial users of the ocean environment.

  {"id":"crossin_etal14","abstract":"For more than 60 yr, electronic tags (including acoustic transmitters, archival loggers, and satellite tags) have been applied to free-ranging marine vertebrates to track their behaviour and characterize their spatial ecology. However, only recently have researchers begun using electronic tags to elucidate the processes that relate directly to fitness, i.e. the ability of organisms to survive and reproduce. We briefly review the history of tracking studies focused on marine vertebrates and then provide a general overview of studies that have used tracking to address fitnessrelated questions. Although many studies have used at-sea movement and activity data to better understand feeding ecology, physiology, and energetics, there is growing interest in the coupling of electronic tracking techniques with other disciplines to resolve the mechanisms underlying individual fitness, or more precisely the proxies thereof (survival, timing of reproduction, foraging success, etc.). We categorized studies into 4 general fitness-related areas: (1) foraging dynamics, energetics, and growth; (2) migration and other non-breeding season activities; (3) survival; and (4) reproduction. Despite recent advances in tracking technologies, which include multi-sensor loggers, tri-axial accelerometers, and miniaturized geopositioning systems, etc., very few studies on wild marine vertebrates truly measure individual fitness or proxies thereof. There is thus a need to design experimental, multi-disciplinary, and longitudinal studies that use genetics, individual-based modeling, and other techniques in an effort to resolve the mechanisms responsible for individual variation in fitness in marine vertebrates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Crossin","given":"Gt"},{"family":"Cooke","given":"Sj"},{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Ja"},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Ra"}],"citation-key":"crossin_etal14","container-title":"Marine Ecology Progress Series","container-title-short":"Mar.

  {"id":"cure_etal13","abstract":"Interactions between individuals of different cetacean species are often observed in the wild. Killer whales (Orcinus orca) can be potential predators of many other cetaceans, and the interception of their vocalizations by unintended cetacean receivers may trigger anti-predator behavior that could mediate predator-prey interactions. We explored the anti-predator behaviour of five typically-solitary male sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) in the Norwegian Sea by playing sounds of mammal-feeding killer whales and monitoring behavioural responses using multi-sensor tags. Our results suggest that, rather than taking advantage of their large aerobic capacities to dive away from the perceived predator, sperm whales responded to killer whale playbacks by interrupting their foraging or resting dives and returning to the surface, changing their vocal production, and initiating a surprising degree of social behaviour in these mostly solitary animals. Thus, the interception of predator vocalizations by male sperm whales disrupted functional behaviours and mediated previously unrecognized anti-predator responses.","author":[{"family":"Curé","given":"Charlotte"},{"family":"Antunes","given":"Ricardo"},{"family":"Alves","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Visser","given":"Fleur"},{"family":"Kvadsheim","given":"Petter H."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Patrick J.

  {"id":"cure_etal15","abstract":"Anti-predator strategies are often defined as ‘flight’ or ‘fight’, based upon prey anatomical adaptations for size, morphology and weapons, as well as observed behaviours in the presence of predators. The humpback whale Megaptera nova eangliae is considered a ‘fight’ specialist based upon anatomy and observations of grouping behaviour and active defence when attacked by killer whales. However, the early stage of humpback whale anti-predator strategy, when the prey detects the presence of a distant potential predator that may not have perceived it, has never been described. Our aim was to experimentally examine this initial stage of anti-predator responses. Humpbacks are likely to hear well at the frequencies of killer whale vocalisations, thus the perception of killer whale sounds could trigger anti-predator responses. To address this hypo thesis, we played mammal-eating killer whale sounds to 8 solitary or paired humpback whales in North Atlantic feeding grounds and monitored their behavioural responses. We found that predator sound playbacks induced a cessation of feeding, a change in the diving pattern and a clear directional and rapid horizontal avoidance away from the speaker. Interestingly, in mothercalf pairs with young calves, the directional horizontal avoidance was atypically alternated by 90 degree turns, which may serve as a mechanism to better track the pre dator or a stealth tactic when more vulnerable animals are present. These results provide experimental evidence that humpback whales can exhibit a strong horizontal avoidance as an initial stage of anti-predator defence, indicating that anti-predator responses may be more graded and mixed than previously recognized.","author":[{"family":"Curé","given":"Charlotte"},{"family":"Sivle","given":"Lise Doksæter"},{"family":"Visser","given":"Fleur"},{"family":"Wensveen","given":"Paul J."},{"family":"Isojunno","given":"Saana"},{"family":"Harris","given":"Catriona M."},{"family":"Kvadsheim","given":"Petter H."},{"family":"Lam","given":"Frans-Peter A."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Patrick J.

  {"id":"czapanskiy_etal21","abstract":"Anthropogenic noise is a pervasive and increasing source of disturbance to wildlife. Marine mammals exhibit behavioural and physiological responses to naval sonar and other sound sources. The lost foraging opportunities and elevated locomotor effort associated with sonar disturbance likely carry energetic costs, which may lead to population-level consequences. We modelled the energetic costs associated with behavioural responses using (a) empirical datasets of cetacean feeding rates and prey characteristics and (b) allometry of swimming performance and metabolic rates. We applied our model to compare the short-term (i.e. the scale of the disturbance response; hours to days) energetic costs of a variety of observed behavioural responses. Efficient foragers (e.g. baleen whales) incur a greater relative energetic cost for mild behavioural responses as compared to the most extreme observed response for larger odontocetes (e.g. beaked whales). Energetic costs are more sensitive to lost feeding opportunities than increased energy expenditure from elevated locomotor effort. To scale up from short-term costs to long-term effects (months to years), future research should address individuals’ capacity to compensate for energetic losses as well as energetic thresholds for demographic rates (survival, fecundity). We discuss how relative energetic costs correlate with species’ pace of life and the implications for conservation planning. Synthesis and applications. Current approaches towards understanding the Population Consequences of Disturbance (PCoD) often must rely on expert opinion due to data deficiency. Our model provides an empirical method for linking behaviour to energetics, which is critical for managers to make informed decisions on actions that may affect marine mammal species. Furthermore, our model is applicable to other forms of disturbance, such as vessel traffic or seismic exploration, and our scaling approach enables risk projections for understudied species. ​","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Czapanskiy","given":"Max F."},{"family":"Savoca","given":"Matthew S."},{"family":"Gough","given":"William T."},{"family":"Segre","given":"Paolo S."},{"family":"Wisniewska","given":"Danuta M."},{"family":"Cade","given":"David E."},{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Jeremy A."}],"citation-key":"czapanskiy_etal21","container-title":"Journal of Applied Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2664.13903","ISSN":"1365-2664","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","page":"1643-1657","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Modelling short-term energetic costs of sonar disturbance to cetaceans using high-resolution foraging data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2664.13903","volume":"58"},

Second, we summarise the main lessons learned from current POLS research included in this topical collection. Based on an assessment of the current state of the theoretical foundations and the empirical support of the POLS hypothesis, we propose (i) conceptual refinements of theory, particularly with respect to the role of ecology in the evolution of (sexual dimorphism in) POLS, and (ii) methodological and statistical approaches to the study of POLS at all major levels of variation. This topical collection further holds (iii) key empirical examples demonstrating how POLS structures may be studied in wild populations of (non)human animals, and (iv) a modelling paper predicting POLS under various ecological conditions.

Here we report data from sound and movement recording DTags placed on 23 short-finned pilot whales off Tenerife to study the foraging strategies used to catch deep-water prey. 2. Day and night foraging dives had a maximum depth and duration of 1018 m and 21 min. Vocal behaviour during dives was consistent with biosonar-based foraging, with long series of echolocation clicks interspersed with buzzes. Similar buzzes have been associated with prey capture attempts in other echolocating species. 3. Foraging dives seemed to adapt to circadian rhythms. Deep dives during the day were deeper, but contained fewer buzzes (median 1), than night-time deep dives (median 5 buzzes). 4. In most deep (540‐1019 m) daytime dives with buzzes, a downward directed sprint reaching up to 9 m s ‐1 occurred just prior to a buzz and coincided with the deepest point in the dive, suggestive of a chase after escaping prey. 5. A large percentage (10‐36%) of the drag-related locomotion cost of these dives (15 min long) is spent in sprinting (19‐79 s). This energetic foraging tactic focused on a single or few prey items has not been observed previously in deep-diving mammals but resembles the high-risk/high-gain strategy of some terrestrial hunters such as cheetahs. 6. Deep sprints contrast with the expectation that deep-diving mammals will swim at moderate speeds optimized to reduce oxygen consumption and maximize foraging time at depth. Pilot whales may have developed this tactic to target a deep-water niche formed by large/calorific/fast moving prey such as giant squid.","author":[{"family":"Soto","given":"Natacha Aguilar","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Madsen","given":"Peter T."},{"family":"Díaz","given":"Francisca"},{"family":"Domínguez","given":"Iván"},{"family":"Brito","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Tyack","given":"Peter L."}],"citation-key":"desoto_etal08","container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01393.x","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,9,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2136024381","page":"936-947","PMID":"18444999","title":"Cheetahs of the deep sea: deep foraging sprints in short-finned pilot whales off Tenerife (Canary Islands)","type":"article-journal","volume":"77"},
  {"id":"desoto_etal20","abstract":"Fear of predation can induce profound changes in the behaviour and physiology of prey species even if predator encounters are infrequent. For echolocating toothed whales, the use of sound to forage exposes them to detection by eavesdropping predators, but while some species exploit social defences or produce cryptic acoustic signals, deep-diving beaked whales, well known for mass-strandings induced by navy sonar, seem enigmatically defenceless against their main predator, killer whales. Here we test the hypothesis that the stereotyped group diving and vocal behaviour of beaked whales has benefits for abatement of predation risk and thus could have been driven by fear of predation over evolutionary time. Biologging data from 14 Blainville’s and 12 Cuvier’s beaked whales show that group members have an extreme synchronicity, overlapping vocal foraging time by 98% despite hunting individually, thereby reducing group temporal availability for acoustic detection by killer whales to <25%. Groups also perform a coordinated silent ascent in an unpredictable direction, covering a mean of 1km horizontal distance from their last vocal position. This tactic sacrifices 35% of foraging time but reduces by an order of magnitude the risk of interception by killer whales. These predator abatement behaviours have likely served beaked whales over millions of years, but may become maladaptive by playing a role in mass strandings induced by man-made predator-like sonar sounds.","author":[{"family":"Soto","given":"Natacha Aguilar","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Visser","given":"Fleur"},{"family":"Tyack","given":"Peter L."},{"family":"Alcazar","given":"Jesús"},{"family":"Ruxton","given":"Graeme D."},{"family":"Arranz","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Madsen","given":"Peter T."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"desoto_etal20","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-019-55911-3","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,6]]},"note":"MAG ID: 3005099644","page":"13-13","PMCID":"7005263","PMID":"32029750","title":"Fear of Killer Whales Drives Extreme Synchrony in Deep Diving Beaked Whales","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

Beaked whales tagged with sound and movement loggers exemplify this scenario: they precisely synchronize group vocal and diving activity but produce non-overlapping short acoustic cues.

The propulsive wavelength for the tunas (1.23–1.29L, where L is fork length) is 30–60 % longer than in other cruise-adapted teleosts such as salmonids. The resulting thunniform swimming mode and the morphological and anatomical adaptations associated with the long propulsive wavelength (e.g. fusiform body shape, rigid vertebral column) act to minimize anterior resistance and maximize caudal thrust. The long propulsive wavelength also increases the maximum l which, in concert with the elevated muscle temperatures of tunas, increases their maximum swimming velocity.","author":[{"family":"Dewar","given":"Heidi"},{"family":"Graham","given":"Jeffrey B"}],"citation-key":"dewar_graham94","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Biology","issued":{"date-parts":[[1994]]},"language":"en","page":"15","source":"Zotero","title":"Studies of tropical tuna swimming performance in a large water tunnel","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"diclemente_etal18","abstract":"Whale watching can affect cetacean behaviour, and can in some cases lead to long-term negative effects on survival and reproduction. The waters of Juneau (Alaska) represent a summer feeding ground for the Central North Pacific stock of humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae (Borowski, 1781). The recent dramatic expansion of the local whale-watching industry has raised concerns over the potential negative impact of such activity on the whales. The aim of this study was to understand the impact of whale-watching vessels on humpback whale behaviour in Juneau. From June to September 2015, land-based observations were conducted to record whale behaviour in the presence and absence of vessels. Markov chains and model simulations showed that the presence of vessels was not associated with a reduction in the time spent feeding. Whales exhibited more surface-active behaviour and travelled less in the presence of vessels. The lack of an overt response of feeding whales to whale-watching disturbance could result from the importance of the Southeast Alaska study region as a feeding ground, which could make the whales less apt to interrupt feeding under disturbance; however, The high proportion of travelling observed may indicate that the study area represents a travelling corridor between other, localized feeding areas. The increase in surface-active behaviour may represent a response to vessel presence that could potentially lead to energetic consequences. The large number of whale-watching vessels operating could lead to the increased tolerance of whales towards whale-watching activities. The lack of responses in this study may suggest that the reactions of whales are context specific, depending on their previous experience with vessels and their foraging behaviour, for example. Subtler negative effects could still occur, however, and a prolonged monitoring programme is required to assess less overt behavioural responses of whales over time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Di Clemente","given":"Jacopo"},{"family":"Christiansen","given":"Fredrik"},{"family":"Pirotta","given":"Enrico"},{"family":"Steckler","given":"Dave"},{"family":"Wahlberg","given":"Magnus"},{"family":"Pearson","given":"Heidi Christine"}],"citation-key":"diclemente_etal18","container-title":"Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems","DOI":"10.1002/aqc.2909","ISSN":"1099-0755","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","page":"810-820","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Effects of whale watching on the activity budgets of humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae (Borowski, 1781), on a feeding ground","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aqc.2909","volume":"28"},

The scheme links the environment, pathways, traits, and genes, and highlights the selective forces that shape and maintain migratory adaptation. We endorse an individual-based behavioral definition of migration that allows an objective distinction between migration and other forms of movement. We recognize migration as an adaptation to resources that fluctuate spatiotemporally either seasonally or less predictably, and note that it is often preemptive. Migration plays a central role in the spatial dynamics of mobile populations, and is largely distinct in both form and function from the within-population mixing arising from postnatal dispersal and from the interpatch movements characteristic of metapopulations.

  {"id":"dolphin87","abstract":"The ventilatory and dive behaviors of humpback whales were studied during July–September 1982–1984 in the area of Frederick Sound, Alaska. Oxygen utilization and energy expenditure were estimated based upon observed blow rates and calculated tidal volume during foraging at identified depths between 0 and 120 m. Duration of dive, duration of surfacing, and number of blows per surfacing were all strongly correlated with depth of dive. Dives tended to be short (57.4% were less than 2.8 min in duration) and shallow (84.6% were to depths of less than 60 m). Humpback whales dived and returned to the surface directly, which allowed for calculation of the time spent at depth in different diving situations. The percent of time spent at the surface tended to increase with increasing depth of dive and exhibited a marked increase at depths surpassing 60 m. The lowest oxygen utilization rate was found during dives 41–60 m in depth. Oxygen utilization per ventilation–dive cycle was strongly and positively correlated with depth of dive. It is postulated that dives to depths of 41–60 m (4–6 min in duration) represent the aerobic limit of humpback whales. Dives exceeding these limits result in anaerobic metabolism and, consequently, an inefficient use of time and energy resources.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Dolphin","given":"William Ford"}],"citation-key":"dolphin87","container-title":"Canadian Journal of Zoology","container-title-short":"Can.

  {"id":"dolphin88","abstract":"The foraging behavior of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) summering in southeast Alaska was studied from 1979 to 1984 using surface observations, a 120-kHz echo sounder, and remotely operated underwater cameras. Considerations of foraging costs as well as profits appear to play a dominant role in determining feeding dive patterns of the whales. The energy costs of diving, based on observed blow rates, estimated tidal volume, and O2 extraction efficiency, have previously been shown to increase with increasing depth of dive during foraging episodes. Time spent diving into and returning from a prey patch, and time spent at the surface recovering from a dive represent the time costs of foraging. The percentage of time available for actual capture of prey decreased with increasing depth of dive. Thus, time and energy costs were highly correlated with the depth of the target prey patch. In conjunction with acoustic scans, the underwater cameras made possible the accurate determination of potential prey patch depths, densities, and vertical extent. Prey patches were ranked using a derived weighted density value and associated time and energy expenditure required of the whales to feed upon the patch (viz., gain–cost representation). Foraging models incorporating prey patch density value and time and energy costs of diving resulted in the best fit when compared with observed foraging patterns of the humpback whales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Dolphin","given":"William Ford"}],"citation-key":"dolphin88","container-title":"Canadian Journal of Zoology","container-title-short":"Can.

The kinematics of tailslapping were analysed in detail. Tail-slaps were made up of a biphasic behaviour consisting of two phases with opposite angles of attack, a preparatory phase (negative angles of attack) and a slap phase (positive angles of attack). During the slap phase, the mean maximum angle of attack of the ﬂukes was 47 °.

  {"id":"domenici01","abstract":"During predator᎐prey encounters, a high locomotor performance in unsteady manoeuvres Ži.e. acceleration, turning. is desirable for both predators and prey. While speed increases with size in ﬁsh and other aquatic vertebrates in continuous swimming, the speed achieved within a given time, a relevant parameter in predator᎐prey encounters, is size independent. In addition, most parameters indicating high performance in unsteady swimming decrease with size. Both theoretical considerations and data on acceleration suggest a decrease with body size. Small turning radii and high turning rates are indices of manoeuvrability in space and in time, respectively. Manoeuvrability decreases with body length, as minimum turning radii and maximum turning rates increase and decrease with body length, respectively. In addition, the scaling of linear performance in ﬁsh locomotion may be modulated by turning behaviour, which is an essential component of the escape response. In angelﬁsh, for example, the speed of large ﬁsh is inversely related to their turning angle, i.e. ﬁsh escaping at large turning angles show lower speed than ﬁsh escaping at small turning angles. The scaling of unsteady locomotor performance makes it difﬁcult for large aquatic vertebrates to capture elusive prey by using whole-body attacks, since the overall manoeuvrability and acceleration of small prey is likely to be superior to that of large predators. Feeding strategies in vertebrate predators can be related to the predator᎐prey length ratios. At prey᎐predator ratios higher than approximately 10y2, vertebrate predators are particulate feeders, while at smaller ratios, they tend to be ﬁlter feeders. At intermediate ratios, large aquatic predators may use a variety of feeding methods that aid, or do not involve, whole body attacks. Among these are bubble curtains used by humpback whales to trap ﬁsh schools, and tail-slapping of ﬁsh by delphinids. Tail slapping by killer whales is discussed as an example of these strategies. The speed and acceleration achieved by the ﬂukes of killer whales during tail slaps are higher and comparable, respectively, to those that can be expected in their prey, making tail-slapping an effective predator behaviour. ᮊ 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Optimal foraging theory predicts that breath-hold divers should adjust time allocation within their dives to the distance separating prey from the surface. Quantitative tests of these models have been hampered by the difficulty of documenting underwater feeding behavior and the lack of systems, experimental or natural, in which prey depth varies over a large range. We tested these predictions on blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus), which track the diel vertical migration of their prey. A model using simple allometric arguments successfully predicted diving behavior measured with data loggers. Foraging times within each dive increased to compensate longer transit times and optimize resource acquisition. Shallow dives were short and yielded the highest feeding rates, explaining why feeding activity was more intense at night. An optimal framework thus provides powerful tools to predict the behavior of free-ranging marine predators and inform conservation studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Doniol-Valcroze","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Lesage","given":"Véronique"},{"family":"Giard","given":"Janie"},{"family":"Michaud","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"doniol-valcroze_etal11","container-title":"Behavioral Ecology","container-title-short":"Behavioral Ecology","DOI":"10.1093/beheco/arr038","ISSN":"1045-2249","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"page":"880-888","source":"Silverchair","title":"Optimal foraging theory predicts diving and feeding strategies of the largest marine predator","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arr038","volume":"22"},

A rigid body should restrict maneuverability with regard to turn radius and turn rate. To test if turning maneuvers by the Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis) are constrained by rigidity, captive animals were videorecorded overhead as the animals routinely swam around a large circular tank or during feeding bouts. Turning performance was classified into three different types: (1) glide turns, where the tuna uses the caudal fin as a rudder; (2) powered turns, where the animal uses continuous near symmetrical strokes of the caudal fin through the turn; and (3) ratchet turns, where the overall global turn is completed by a series of small local turns by asymmetrical stokes of the caudal fin. Individual points of the rostrum, peduncle and tip of the caudal fin were tracked and analyzed. Frame-by-frame analysis showed that the ratchet turn had the fastest turn rate for all points with a maximum of 302 deg s−1. During the ratchet turn, the rostrum exhibited a minimum global 0.38 body length turn radius. The local turn radii were only 18.6% of the global ratchet turn. The minimum turn radii ranged from 0.4 to 1.7 body lengths. Compared with the performance of other swimmers, the increased flexion of the peduncle and tail and the mechanics of turning behaviors used by tuna overcomes any constraints to turning performance from the rigidity of the anterior body morphology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Downs","given":"Abigail M."},{"family":"Kolpas","given":"Allison"},{"family":"Block","given":"Barbara A."},{"family":"Fish","given":"Frank E."}],"citation-key":"downs_etal23","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Biology","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Biology","DOI":"10.1242/jeb.244144","ISSN":"0022-0949","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023]]},"page":"jeb244144","source":"Silverchair","title":"Multiple behaviors for turning performance of Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.244144","volume":"226"},

This migration route from Svalbard to Greenland is among the longest recorded distances for an alcid species.

  {"id":"dulau-drouot_etal17","abstract":"Humpback whales are known to undertake long-distance migration between feeding and breeding sites, but their movement behavior within their breeding range is still poorly known. Satellite telemetry was used to investigate movement of humpback whales during the breeding season and provide further understanding of the breeding ecology and sub-population connectivity within the southwest Indian Ocean (SWIO). Implantable Argos satellite tags were deployed on 15 whales (7 males and 6 females) during the peak of the breeding season in Reunion Island. A switching-state-space model was applied to the telemetry data, in order to discriminate between “transiting” and “localized” movements, the latter of which relates to meandering behavior within putative breeding habitats, and a kernel density analysis was used to assess the spatial scale of the main putative breeding sites. Whales were tracked for up to 71days from 31/07/2013 to 16/10/2013. The mean transmission duration was 25.7days and the mean distance travelled was 2125.8km. The tracks showed consistent movement of whales from Reunion to Madagascar, demonstrating a high level of connectivity between the two sub-regions, and the use of yet unknown breeding sites such as underwater seamounts (La Perouse) and banks (Mascarene Plateau). A localized movement pattern occurred in distinct bouts along the tracks, suggesting that whales were involved in breeding activity for 4.3 consecutive days on average, after which they resume transiting for an average of 6.6days. Males visited several breeding sites within the SWIO, suggesting for the first time a movement strategy at a basin scale to maximize mating. Unexpectedly, females with calf also showed extensive transiting movement, while they engaged in localized behavior mainly off Reunion and Sainte-Marie (East Madagascar). The results indicated that whales from Reunion do not represent a discrete population. Discrete breeding sites were identified, thereby highlighting priority areas for conservation. The study is a first attempt to quantify movement of humpback whales within the southwestern Indian Ocean breeding range. We demonstrate a wandering behavior with stopovers at areas that likely represent key breeding habitat, a strategy which may enhance likelihood of individual reproductive success.","author":[{"family":"Dulau-Drouot","given":"Violaine"},{"family":"Dulau","given":"Violaine"},{"family":"Pinet","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Geyer","given":"Ygor"},{"family":"Fayan","given":"Jacques"},{"family":"Mongin","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Cottarel","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Zerbini","given":"Alexandre N."},{"literal":"Salvatore Cerchio"},{"family":"Cerchio","given":"Salvatore"},{"literal":"Salvatore Cerchio"}],"citation-key":"dulau-drouot_etal17","container-title":"Movement ecology","DOI":"10.1186/s40462-017-0101-5","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2598847888","page":"11-11","PMID":"28469920","title":"Continuous movement behavior of humpback whales during the breeding season in the southwest Indian Ocean: on the road again!","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

During the inter-nesting period (typically March–July) turtles ranged widely, but frequented the area around Galera Point on the NE corner of Trinidad. Diving depths were typically <51 m. Upon leaving Trinidad, the three longest tracked turtles moved to higher latitude foraging areas, NE of the Flemish Cap; along the continental shelf of the Iberian peninsula to the Bay of Biscay; and along the N. Atlantic subtropical front, where they remained until the end of November. Dives were initially deep (100–300 m) and long (>26 min) as the turtles left the Caribbean, but became very shallow (>50 m) and short at high latitudes. Between mid-October and mid-November, the turtles left high latitudes for a presumed foraging area in the Mauritania upwelling where they resided until their tracking records ended. Diving remained relatively shallow. It is proposed that movements of these turtles from one foraging area to another are driven by the opportunity to forage in areas of distinct oceanic structure which serve to concentrate their gelatinous prey (e.g., salps, Scyphomedusae, Siphonophora) either at or below the surface.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Eckert","given":"Scott A."}],"citation-key":"eckert06","container-title":"Marine Biology","container-title-short":"Mar Biol","DOI":"10.1007/s00227-006-0262-z","ISSN":"1432-1793","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1257-1267","source":"Springer Link","title":"High-use oceanic areas for Atlantic leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) as identified using satellite telemetered location and dive information","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00227-006-0262-z","volume":"149"},

Prior investigations on whale locomotion based on anatomical inference or surface observations did not describe any specific underwater use of the humpbacks' uniquely long flippers. Our results show that humpbacks achieve a high degree of maneuverability underwater through the active coordinated use of their flippers. Three-dimensional active movements including protraction-retraction, abduction-adduction, and lateral-medial rotations, were observed. The whales could move themselves in all directions independent from fluke-generated forward motion by thrusting with their resilient flippers. At higher swimming speeds (>4 knots) the flippers were used to effect sharply executed ascending or descending banked turns. Analysis of filmed sequences from three adult-calf encounters indicated a reduction of the amplitude and frequency of tailbeats by the adults; calves made tailbeats 4 to 7 times more frequently than adults when maintaining the same speed. The tail and flukes are forcefully moved other than vertically during maneuvering. The significance of these findings is discussed in relation to our knowledge of larger whales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Edel","given":"R.

  {"id":"elmegaard_etal16","abstract":"Marine mammals have adapted to forage while holding their breath in a suite of aquatic habitats from shallow rivers to deep oceans. The key to tolerate such extensive apnea is the dive response, which comprises bradycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction. Although initially considered an all-or-nothing reflex [1], numerous studies on freely diving marine mammals have revealed substantial dynamics of the dive response to meet the impending dive demands of depth, duration and exercise [2]. Such adjustments are not only autonomic responses, but are under acute cognitive control in pinnipeds [3] living amphibiously on land and in water. The fully aquatic cetaceans would similarly benefit from cognitive cardiovascular control; however, even though they have exercise-modulated diving bradycardia [2] and full voluntary control of their respiratory system to such extent that even mild anesthesia often leads to asphyxiation [4], cognitive cardiovascular control has never been demonstrated for this large group of marine mammals. To address this, we tested the hypothesis that porpoises modulate bradycardia according to anticipated dive duration. Two harbor porpoises, instrumented with ECG recording tags, were trained to perform 20- and 80-second stationary dives, during which they adjusted bradycardia to the anticipated duration, demonstrating cognitive control of their dive response.","author":[{"family":"Elmegaard","given":"Siri L."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Madsen","given":"Peter T."},{"family":"McDonald","given":"Birgitte I."}],"citation-key":"elmegaard_etal16","container-title":"Current Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.cub.2016.10.020","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,21]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2549555051","PMID":"27875692","title":"Cognitive control of heart rate in diving harbor porpoises","type":"article-journal","volume":"26"},

For most vertebrates, the dive response is initiated upon face immersion, but little is known about the physical drivers of diving and surfacing heart rate in cetaceans whose faces are always mostly submerged. Using two trained harbour porpoises instrumented with an ECG-measuring sound-and-movement tag (DTAG-3), we investigated the initiation and progression of bradycardia and tachycardia during apnoea and eupnoea for varying levels of immersion. We show that paranasal wetting drives bradycardia initiation and progression, whereas apnoea leads to dive-level bradycardia eventually, but not instantly. At the end of dives, heart rate accelerates independently of lung expansion, perhaps in anticipation of surfacing; however, full tachycardia is only engaged upon inhalation. We conclude that breathing drives surface tachycardia, whereas blowhole wetting is an important driver of bradycardia; however, anticipatory/volitional modulation can overrule such responses to sensory inputs.","author":[{"family":"Elmegaard","given":"Siri L."},{"family":"McDonald","given":"Birgitte I."},{"family":"Madsen","given":"Peter T."}],"citation-key":"elmegaard_etal19","container-title":"The Journal of Experimental Biology","DOI":"10.1242/jeb.208637","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2972640090","PMID":"31511341","title":"Drivers of the dive response in trained harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena)","type":"article-journal","volume":"222"},

  {"id":"evans_bearhop22","abstract":"Abstract Animal migrations represent the regular movements of trillions of individuals. The scale of these movements has inspired human intrigue for millennia and has been intensively studied by biologists. This research has highlighted the diversity of migratory strategies seen across and within migratory taxa: while some migrants temporarily express phenotypes dedicated to travel, others show little or no phenotypic flexibility in association with migration. However, a vocabulary for describing these contrasting solutions to the performance trade-offs inherent to the highly dynamic lifestyle of migrants (and strategies intermediate between these two extremes) is currently missing. We propose a taxon-independent organising framework based on energetics, distinguishing between migrants that forage as they travel (income migrants) and those that fuel migration using energy acquired before departure (capital migrants). Not only does our capital:income continuum of migratory energetics account for the variable extent of phenotypic flexibility within and across migrant populations, but it also aligns with theoreticians' treatment of migration and clarifies how migration impacts other phases of the life cycle. As such, it provides a unifying scale and common vacabulary for comparing the migratory strategies of divergent taxa.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Evans","given":"Simon R."},{"family":"Bearhop","given":"Stuart"}],"citation-key":"evans_bearhop22","container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2656.13800","ISSN":"1365-2656","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2022 The Authors.

Predators make movement decisions at multiple spatial and temporal scales, yet we have a limited understanding of how habitat selection at multiple scales translates into foraging performance. In the ocean, there is mounting evidence that submesoscale (i.e. less than 100 km) processes drive the formation of dense prey patches that should hypothetically provide feeding hot spots and increase predator foraging success. Here, we integrated environmental remote-sensing with high-resolution animal-borne biologging data to evaluate submesoscale surface current features in relation to the habitat selection and foraging performance of blue whales in the California Current System. Our study revealed a consistent functional relationship in which blue whales disproportionately foraged within dynamic aggregative submesoscale features at both the regional and feeding site scales across seasons, regions and years. Moreover, we found that blue whale feeding rates increased in areas with stronger aggregative features, suggesting that these features indicate areas of higher prey density. The use of fine-scale, dynamic features by foraging blue whales underscores the need to take these features into account when designating critical habitat and may help inform strategies to mitigate the impacts of human activities for the species.","author":[{"family":"Fahlbusch","given":"James A."},{"literal":"Max F.

  {"id":"fearnbach_etal12","abstract":"Identifying demographic changes is important for understanding population dynamics. However, this requires long-term studies of deﬁnable populations of distinct individuals, which can be particularly challenging when studying mobile cetaceans in the marine environment. We collected photo-identiﬁcation data from 19 years (1992–2010) to assess the dynamics of a population of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) restricted to the shallow (,7 m) waters of Little Bahama Bank, northern Bahamas. This population was known to range beyond our study area, so we adopted a Bayesian mixture modeling approach to mark–recapture to identify clusters of individuals that used the area to different extents, and we speciﬁcally estimated trends in survival, recruitment, and abundance of a ‘‘resident’’ population with high probabilities of identiﬁcation. There was a high probability ( p ¼ 0.97) of a long-term decrease in the size of this resident population from a maximum of 47 dolphins (95% highest posterior density intervals, HPDI ¼ 29–61) in 1996 to a minimum of just 24 dolphins (95% HPDI ¼ 14–37) in 2009, a decline of 49% (95% HPDI ¼ À5% to À75%). This was driven by low per capita recruitment (average ;0.02) that could not compensate for relatively low apparent survival rates (average ;0.94). Notably, there was a signiﬁcant increase in apparent mortality (;5 apparent mortalities vs. ;2 on average) in 1999 when two intense hurricanes passed over the study area, with a high probability ( p ¼ 0.83) of a drop below the average survival probability (;0.91 in 1999; ;0.94, on average).

Here we test the claim that extreme protest actions—protest behaviors perceived to be harmful to others, highly disruptive, or both—typically reduce support for social movements. Across 6 experiments, including 3 that were preregistered, participants indicated less support for social movements that used more extreme protest actions. This result obtained across a variety of movements (e.g., animal rights, anti-Trump, anti-abortion) and extreme protest actions (e.g., blocking highways, vandalizing property). Further, in 5 of 6 studies, negative reactions to extreme protest actions also led participants to support the movement’s central cause less, and these effects were largely independent of individuals’ prior ideology or views on the issue. In all studies we found effects were driven by diminished social identification with the movement. In Studies 4 – 6, serial mediation analyses detailed a more in-depth model: observers viewed extreme protest actions to be immoral, reducing observers’ emotional connection to the movement and, in turn, reducing identification with and support for the movement. Taken together with prior research showing that extreme protest actions can be effective for applying pressure to institutions and raising awareness of movements, these findings suggest an activist’s dilemma, in which the same protest actions that may offer certain benefits are also likely to undermine popular support for social movements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Feinberg","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Willer","given":"Robb"},{"family":"Kovacheff","given":"Chloe"}],"citation-key":"feinberg_etal20","container-title":"Journal of Personality and Social Psychology","DOI":"10.1037/pspi0000230","ISSN":"1939-1315, 0022-3514","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","source":"Crossref","title":"The activist’s dilemma: Extreme protest actions reduce popular support for social movements.","title-short":"The activist’s dilemma","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/pspi0000230"},

We used information obtained from six humpback whales tagged off the coast of Ecuador between August and September 2013, and sighting information from oceanographic cruises and seismic prospection studies. Tagged humpback whales were followed along the west coast of South America, and in one case off the Antarctic Peninsula, for between 11 and 72 d. Distance covered by tracked whales was between 920 and 8,670 km. While available sighting data indicated that humpback whales follow a coastal route, satellite tracking data show that single adults use a more direct offshore route and mother/calf pairs tend to follow the longer coastal route. A 4-d period of irregular movements by a mother with a calf off central Peru suggested foraging behavior in this area characterized by intense upwelling processes. On the other hand, the humpback whale that reached Antarctic waters by mid-October quickly moved 200 km off the Antarctic Peninsula, probably because the zone was still covered by ice. We also found differences in travel speed between age/sex classes of humpback whales with mother/calf pairs traveling about 30% slower than single adults. The average humpback whale swim speed ranged between 65.5 and 169 km.d-1.

Overhead video recordings were analyzed for two sea lions (Zalophus californianus) turning in the horizontal plane. Unpowered turns were executed by body ﬂexion in conjunction with use of the pectoral and pelvic ﬂippers, which were used as control surfaces. A 90° bank angle was used in the turns to vertically orient the control surfaces. Turning radius was dependent on body mass and swimming velocity. Relative minimum radii were 9–17% of body length and were equivalent for pinnipeds and cetaceans. However, Zalophus had smaller turning radii at higher speeds than cetaceans. Rate of turn was inversely related to turn radius. The highest turn rate observed in Zalophus was 690 degrees s–1. Centripetal acceleration measured up to 5.1 g for Zalophus. Comparison with other marine mammals indicates that Zalophus has a morphology that enhances instability, thus providing enhanced turning performance.

Humpback whales utilize extremely mobile, wing-like flippers for banking and turning. Large rounded tubercles along the leading edge of the flipper are morphological structures that are unique in nature. The tubercles on the leading edge act as passive-flow control devices that improve performance and maneuverability of the flipper. Experimental analysis of finite wing models has demonstrated that the presence of tubercles produces a delay in the angle of attack until stall, thereby increasing maximum lift and decreasing drag. Possible fluid-dynamic mechanisms for improved performance include delay of stall through generation of a vortex and modification of the boundary layer, and increase in effective span by reduction of both spanwise flow and strength of the tip vortex. The tubercles provide a bio-inspired design that has commercial viability for wing-like structures. Control of passive flow has the advantages of eliminating complex, costly, high-maintenance, and heavy control mechanisms, while improving performance for lifting bodies in air and water. The tubercles on the leading edge can be applied to the design of watercraft, aircraft, ventilation fans, and windmills.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Fish","given":"Frank E."},{"family":"Weber","given":"Paul W."},{"family":"Murray","given":"Mark M."},{"family":"Howle","given":"Laurens E."}],"citation-key":"fish_etal11","container-title":"Integrative and Comparative Biology","container-title-short":"Integrative and Comparative Biology","DOI":"10.1093/icb/icr016","ISSN":"1540-7063","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"page":"203-213","source":"Silverchair","title":"The Tubercles on Humpback Whales' Flippers: Application of Bio-Inspired Technology","title-short":"The Tubercles on Humpback Whales' Flippers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/icr016","volume":"51"},

Previous uses of computational hydrodynamic models and gliding experiments have provided estimates of thrust production by dolphins, but these were indirect tests that relied on various assumptions. The thrust produced by two actively swimming bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) was directly measured using digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). For dolphins swimming in a large outdoor pool, the DPIV method used illuminated microbubbles that were generated in a narrow sheet from a finely porous hose and a compressed air source. The movement of the bubbles was tracked with a high-speed video camera. Dolphins swam at speeds of 0.7 to 3.4 m s−1 within the bubble sheet oriented along the midsagittal plane of the animal. The wake of the dolphin was visualized as the microbubbles were displaced because of the action of the propulsive flukes and jet flow. The oscillations of the dolphin flukes were shown to generate strong vortices in the wake. Thrust production was measured from the vortex strength through the Kutta–Joukowski theorem of aerodynamics. The dolphins generated up to 700 N during small amplitude swimming and up to 1468 N during large amplitude starts. The results of this study demonstrated that bubble DPIV can be used effectively to measure the thrust produced by large-bodied dolphins.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Fish","given":"F.

The problem was that indirect estimates of force production for dolphins resulted in low values that could not be validated. Bubble digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) measured hydrodynamic force production for swimming dolphins and demonstrated high force production. To validate the bubble DPIV and reconcile force production measurements, two bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) performing tail stands were measured with bubble DPIV. Microbubbles were generated from a ﬁnely porous hose and compressed air source. Displacement of the bubbles by the propulsive motions of the dolphin was tracked with a high-speed video camera.

Application of the Kutta–Joukowski theorem measuring vortex circulations yielded forces up to 997.3 N. Another video camera recorded body height above the water surface to determine the mass-force of the dolphin above the water surface. For the dolphin to hold its position above the water surface, the mass-force approximately balanced the vertical hydrodynamic force from the ﬂukes. The results demonstrated the ﬂuke motions generate high sustained forces roughly equal to the dolphin’s weight out of the water.

A total of 552 dogs from 123 breeds ranging in size from Chihuahua to Mastiff were examined. Each dog was weighed on a digital scale while standing, alternating foreleg, and hind leg support. The overall “grand” mean proportion of mass on the forelegs to the total mass was 60.4% (range: 47.6–74.4%). The data set indicated no significant change in the ratio with total mass but there was a significant difference by sex. When separated into American Kennel Club categories, no group was notably different from the grand mean or from each other, but when sex was also considered, there was a significant difference that was not specifically discerned by post hoc analysis. The mean for female Hounds was notably below the grand mean. For clades based on genetics, the mean for European origin mastiffs was notably greater than the grand mean and significantly different from UK origin herders and coursers.

The frequency of the propulsive cycle increased linearly with the swimming velocity, and the maximum angle of attack of the flipper decreased, but the amplitude remained constant. The kinematics and morphology of this hind flipper motion indicated that phocid seals do not swim in the carangiform mode as categorized by Lighthill (1969), but in a distinct mode that mimics swimming by thunniform propulsors. The hind flippers acted as hydrofoils, and the efficiency, thrust power and coefficient of thrust were calculated from unsteady wing theory. The propulsive efficiency was high at approximately 0-85. The thrust power increased curvilinearly with velocity. The drag coefficient ranged from 0-012 to 0-028 and was found to be 2-8-7-0 times higher than the theoretical minimum.

All indications are that the boundary layer is turbulent. (2) Muscles for the upstroke and downstroke of swimming dolphins provide approximately equal power.

Control surfaces include paired and median fins in fishes, and flippers and flukes in secondarily aquatic tetrapods. These structures initially evolved from embryonic fin folds in fishes and have been modified into complex control surfaces in derived aquatic tetrapods. Control surfaces function both actively and passively to produce torque about the center of mass by the generation of either lift or drag, or both, and thus produce vector forces to effect rectilinear locomotion, trim control and maneuvers. In addition to fins and flippers, there are other structures that act as control surfaces and enhance functionality. The entire body can act as a control surface and generate lift for stability in destabilizing flow regimes. Furthermore, control surfaces can undergo active shape change to enhance their performance, and a number of features act as secondary control structures: leading edge tubercles, wing-like canards, multiple fins in series, finlets, keels and trailing edge structures. These modifications to control surface design can alter flow to increase lift, reduce drag and enhance thrust in the case of propulsive fin-based systems in fishes and marine mammals, and are particularly interesting subjects for future research and application to engineered systems.

Semiaquatic mammals swim by paddling, which is inefﬁcient compared to the use of oscillating hydrofoils of aquatic mammals. Semiaquatic mammals swim at the water surface and experience a greater resistive force augmented by wave drag than submerged aquatic mammals. A dense, nonwettable fur insulates semiaquatic mammals, whereas aquatic mammals use a layer of blubber. The fur, while providing insulation and positive buoyancy, incurs a high energy demand for maintenance and limits diving depth. Blubber contours the body to reduce drag, is an energy reserve, and suffers no loss in buoyancy with depth. Despite the high energetic costs of a semiaquatic existence, these animals represent modern analogs of evolutionary intermediates between ancestral terrestrial mammals and their fully aquatic descendants.

This evolutionary trend is exemplified in highly derived aquatic mammals by convergence in body design and mode of swimming, using lift-based propulsion produced by modified hydrofoils. Convergence in morphology and propulsive mechanics is dictated by the need to reduce drag, improve thrust output, augment efficiency and increase speed in animals with increasingly aquatic habits. Examination of swimming by intermediate, semi-aquatic mammals provides opportunities to understand potential selection pressures and the mechanical constraints which may have directed the evolution of the more derived aquatic species and swimming modes. Semi-aquatic mammals swim using their paired appendages in a low efficiency, drag-based mode. This mode of swimming arises from the modification of a preexisting neuromotor pattern, associated with gait patterns characteristic of terrestrial locomotion. The terrestrial neuromotor pattern appears to be conserved in the swimming modes of derived aquatic mammals, suggesting a smooth transition from drag-based to lift-based propulsion.

  {"id":"fish93","abstract":"Optimisation of energy by aquatic mammals requires adaptations that reduce drag, and improve thrust production and efficiency. Drag is minimised by streamlining the body and appendages. Highly derived aquatic mammals have body shapes close to the optimal hydrodynamic design for drag reduction. There is no conclusive evidence for specialised drag reduction mechanisms, although decreasing hair density is associated with reduced drag. Improvement in thrust production and efficiency is accomplished by changes in propulsive mode and appendage design. Semiaquatic mammals employ drag-based propulsion using paddles, whereas fully aquatic mammals use lift-based propulsion with hydrofoils. Because paddling generates thrust through half the stroke cycle, propulsive efficiency is low and energetic cost is high compared with that for mammals using hydrofoils. Lift-based swimming is a rapid and high-powered propulsive mode. Oscillations of the hydrofoil generate thrust throughout the stroke cycle. For cetaceans and pinnipeds, propulsive efficiency is approximately 80%, and transport cost is below that of semiaquatic mammals. Behavioural adaptations help minimise energy expenditure by swimming mammals. Submerged swimming avoids increased drag from energy lost in formation of surface waves. Porpoising and wave riding, characteristic of dolphins, can reduce the transport costs, allowing for longer-duration swimming at high speeds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Fish","given":"Fe"}],"citation-key":"fish93","container-title":"Australian Journal of Zoology","DOI":"10.1071/ZO9940079","ISSN":"0004-959X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1993]]},"language":"en","page":"79","source":"Crossref","title":"Influence of hydrodynamic-design and propulsive mode on mammalian swimming energetics","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.publish.csiro.au/?paper=ZO9940079","volume":"42"},

DESCRIPTION The holotype skull (NMV P216929) is undistorted except for right and left I3, which have been pushed upwards and laterally by dorsoventral diagenetic compression (ﬁgure 1a,c,d ). All skull sutures are fused, and the C1–C3 epiphyses are fused to their respective vertebral centra, indicating that this specimen represents a subadult or adult individual. The skull and dental morphology differs markedly from other mysticetes (ﬁgure 3). Janjucetus was a relatively small cetacean compared to other mysticetes, with a preserved condylobasal length (CBL) of 46 cm, suggesting a total body length of no more than approximately 3.5 m. The rostrum is triangular, broad-based, foreshortened (its length being 38% of CBL) and high; unlike more derived mysticetes, the rostrum is not dorsoventrally ﬂattened. The orbits open anterolaterally, are ovoid in outline, and relatively enormous for a cetacean (orbit diameter (OD)/CBL is 24%; ﬁgure 1b,c). The cranium is very broad, accommodating the voluminous temporal fossae. Frontals and parietals are extensively exposed in an elongated intertemporal constriction. The rostral portions of the premaxillae are robust, and on the anterior half of the rostrum, overhang the maxillae. The apical premaxillae form a distinctive incisor-bearing rosette (ﬁgure 1a,c). The maxilla represents 79% of rostral length, with its ascending process terminating anterior to the posterior edge of the nasal. The palatal surface of the maxilla (ﬁgure 1d ) lacks any grooves and/or nutrient foramina correlated with the possession of baleen (Fordyce & Muizon 2001; Deme´re´ 2005). The nasals are elongated and plate-like, with the external bony nares probably being located at a point level with M1.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Fitzgerald","given":"Erich M.G"}],"citation-key":"fitzgerald06","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2006.3664","ISSN":"0962-8452, 1471-2954","issue":"1604","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"language":"en","page":"2955-2963","source":"Crossref","title":"A bizarre new toothed mysticete (Cetacea) from Australia and the early evolution of baleen whales","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2006.3664","volume":"273"},

Using empirical and computational fluid dynamics analyses, we show that remora attachment was specific to regions of separating flow and wakes caused by surface features on the whale. Adhesion at these locations offers remoras drag reduction of up to 71–84% compared with the freestream. Remoras were observed to move freely along the surface of the whale using skimming and sliding behaviors. Skimming provided drag reduction as high as 50–72% at some locations for some remora sizes, but little to none was available in regions where few to no remoras were observed. Experimental work suggests that the Venturi effect may help remoras stay near the whale while skimming.

  {"id":"fleming_etal16","abstract":"Large, migratory predators are often cited as sentinel species for ecosystem processes and climate-related changes, but their utility as indicators is dependent upon an understanding of their response to environmental variability. Documentation of the links between climate variability, ecosystem change and predator dynamics is absent for most top predators. Identifying species that may be useful indicators and elucidating these mechanistic links provides insight into current ecological dynamics and may inform predictions of future ecosystem responses to climatic change. We examine humpback whale response to environmental variability through stable isotope analysis of diet over a dynamic 20-year period (1993–2012) in the California Current System (CCS). Humpback whale diets captured two major shifts in oceanographic and ecological conditions in the CCS. Isotopic signatures reflect a diet dominated by krill during periods characterized by positive phases of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), cool sea surface temperature (SST), strong upwelling and high krill biomass. In contrast, humpback whale diets are dominated by schooling fish when the NPGO is negative, SST is warmer, seasonal upwelling is delayed and anchovy and sardine populations display increased biomass and range expansion. These findings demonstrate that humpback whales trophically respond to ecosystem shifts, and as a result, their foraging behavior is a synoptic indicator of oceanographic and ecological conditions across the CCS. Multi-decadal examination of these sentinel species thus provides insight into biological consequences of interannual climate fluctuations, fundamental to advancing ecosystem predictions related to global climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Fleming","given":"Alyson H."},{"family":"Clark","given":"Casey T."},{"family":"Calambokidis","given":"John"},{"family":"Barlow","given":"Jay"}],"citation-key":"fleming_etal16","container-title":"Global Change Biology","DOI":"10.1111/gcb.13171","ISSN":"1365-2486","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"1214-1224","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Humpback whale diets respond to variance in ocean climate and ecosystem conditions in the California Current","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.13171","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"fordyce_marx18","abstract":"Baleen whales (Mysticeti) are the largest animals on Earth, thanks to their ability to ﬁlter huge volumes of small prey from seawater. Mysticetes appeared during the Late Eocene, but evidence of their early evolution remains both sparse and controversial [1, 2], with several models competing to explain the origin of baleen-based bulk feeding [3–6]. Here, we describe a virtually complete skull of Llanocetus denticrenatus, the second-oldest (ca. 34 Ma) mysticete known. The new material represents the same individual as the type and only specimen, a fragmentary mandible. Phylogenetic analysis groups Llanocetus with the oldest mysticete, Mystacodon selenensis [2], into the basal family Llanocetidae. Llanocetus is gigantic (body length $8 m) compared to other early mysticetes [7–9]. The broad rostrum has sharp, widely spaced teeth with marked dental abrasion and attrition, suggesting biting and occlusal shearing. As in extant mysticetes, the palate bears many sulci, commonly interpreted as osteological correlates of baleen [3]. Unexpectedly, these sulci converge on the upper alveoli, suggesting a peridental blood supply to well-developed gums, rather than to inter-alveolar racks of baleen. We interpret Llanocetus as a raptorial or suction feeder, revealing that whales evolved gigantism well before the emergence of ﬁlter feeding. Rather than driving the origin of mysticetes, baleen and ﬁltering most likely only arose after an initial phase of suction-assisted raptorial feeding [2, 4, 5]. This scenario differs strikingly from that proposed for odontocetes, whose deﬁning adaptation—echolocation—was present even in their earliest representatives [10].","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Fordyce","given":"R.

Body lengths from 154 individuals revealed that calves more than doubled in size and attained three-fourths of asymptotic adult size by the time they had weaned at 12 months. Calves gained on average ∼1.7 cm and ∼34 kg per day while nursing during this extremely rapid growth phase. Mean predicted lengths and body mass were 4.2 m and 1.1 metric tons (mt) at birth, 10.3 m and 13.5 mt at weaning, and 13.6 m and 29.6 mt when fully grown. Growth of right whales was best described using a 2-phased Gompertz growth model and could not be fit using any of the single continuous growth models commonly used for other mammals. Rapid growth during dependency may minimize the risk of predation and maximize calf survival. Rapid calf growth also may maximize development of the mouth and baleen to optimize foraging efficiency of juveniles at the time of weaning, as well as improve reproductive fitness by reducing the age at which sexual maturity is attained. However, transferring the amount of energy needed to support the rapid postnatal growth of North Atlantic right whales may ultimately affect the intervals between pregnancies (&gt; 3 years) of mature females.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Fortune","given":"Sarah M.

However, recovery may also be limited because individuals are under nutritional stress. We quantified the food requirements of North Atlantic right whales by age, sex and reproductive state and compared their predicted needs with field estimates of prey consumption to assess whether any demographic group of right whales might be nutritionally stressed. Energy requirements were estimated using a bioenergetics model that accounted for uncertainty in energy inputs and outputs. Consumption was estimated with prey samples taken near feeding whales in Cape Cod Bay (n = 28 net collections) and the Bay of Fundy (n = 19 optical plankton recordings). We found that calves required the least energy (~1767 MJ d−1) and that lactating females required the most (~4120 MJ d−1). Juveniles required considerably more energy than adult males and non-reproductive females. Our estimates of energy requirements for juveniles (~1906 MJ d−1), adult males (~1793 MJ d−1), and nonreproductive females (~2104 MJ d−1) compared favorably with estimates of actual consumption in Cape Cod Bay and the Bay of Fundy (i.e. they differed by ≤15%), suggesting that our model was reliable. However, lactating females appear to have obtained considerably less than their predicted energy requirements in both habitats.

To measure, in fine detail, the 3-dimensional orientation and movement patterns of hump- back whales underwater, we used a multi-sensor tag attached via suction cups (DTAG). We tested the specific hypothesis that the diel movement patterns of sand lance between bottom substrate and the water column correlates to changes between surface and bottom feeding strategies of humpback whales on Stellwagen Bank, MA. We collected over 96 h of both day- and nighttime data from 15 whales in 2006, and recorded 393 surface and 230 bottom feeding events. Individual whales exhibit both surface and bottom feeding behaviors, switching from one to the other in relation to changing light and prey conditions. Surface feeding behaviors were individually variable in their constitution but ubiquitously biased towards daylight hours, when prey was most abundant in the upper portion of the water column. Bottom feeding behavior occurred largely at night, coincident with when sand lance descend to seek refuge in the substrate.

How these whales feed and optimize the consumption of prey resources prior to long-distance migrations and fasting is largely unknown. We deployed multi-sensor tags on humpback whales around the western Antarctic Peninsula to describe their daily activity patterns late in the feeding season to test the hypothesis that feeding behavior varies over the diel cycle so as to maximize energy intake and limit energy expenditure. Dives were assigned to a behavioral state (feeding, resting, traveling, exploring) to determine hourly rates and to build an ethogram of activity patterns. Our results show a distinct diel pattern of whales feeding exclusively at night. Feeding depth was deeper around sunrise/sunset and shallower (~50 m) at night, consistent with diel vertical prey move- ment. Shallow feeding dives typically contained a single feeding lunge, a strategy known to increase feeding efficiency and maximize intake rates by maintaining proximity to the surface and reducing the energetic costs of deep diving. The lack of feeding during daytime may indicate prey being too deep for efficient foraging. Our results add information where currently there is a paucity of data describing how baleen whales optimize feeding behavior, specifically in relation to prey distribution and movement, to fuel their extraordinary energetic requirements necessary for growth, migration, and reproduction.

  {"id":"friedlaender_etal16","abstract":"Air-breathing marine animals face a complex set of physical challenges associated with diving that affect the decisions of how to optimize feeding. Baleen whales (Mysticeti) have evolved bulk-filter feeding mechanisms to efficiently feed on dense prey patches. Baleen whales are central place foragers where oxygen at the surface represents the central place and depth acts as the distance to prey. Although hypothesized that baleen whales will target the densest prey patches anywhere in the water column, how depth and density interact to influence foraging behaviour is poorly understood. We used multi-sensor archival tags and active acoustics to quantify Antarctic humpback whale foraging behaviour relative to prey. Our analyses reveal multi-stage foraging decisions driven by both krill depth and density. During daylight hours when whales did not feed, krill were found in deep high-density patches. As krill migrated vertically into larger and less dense patches near the surface, whales began to forage. During foraging bouts, we found that feeding rates (number of feeding lunges per hour) were greatest when prey was shallowest, and feeding rates decreased with increasing dive depth. This strategy is consistent with previous models of how air-breathing diving animals optimize foraging efficiency. Thus, humpback whales forage mainly when prey is more broadly distributed and shallower, presumably to minimize diving and searching costs and to increase feeding rates overall and thus foraging efficiency. Using direct measurements of feeding behaviour from animal-borne tags and prey availability from echosounders, our study demonstrates a multi-stage foraging process in a central place forager that we suggest acts to optimize overall efficiency by maximizing net energy gain over time. These data reveal a previously unrecognized level of complexity in predator–prey interactions and underscores the need to simultaneously measure prey distribution in marine central place forager studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari S."},{"family":"Johnston","given":"David W."},{"family":"Tyson","given":"Reny B."},{"family":"Kaltenberg","given":"Amanda"},{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Jeremy A."},{"family":"Stimpert","given":"Alison K."},{"family":"Curtice","given":"Corrie"},{"family":"Hazen","given":"Elliott L."},{"family":"Halpin","given":"Patrick N."},{"family":"Read","given":"Andrew J."},{"family":"Nowacek","given":"Douglas P."}],"citation-key":"friedlaender_etal16","container-title":"Royal Society Open Science","container-title-short":"R.

By fitting tri-axial movement sensors to blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus), and by recording the direction and size of their rolls during lunge feeding events, we show how these animals differ from such a paradigm. The strength and direction of individuals’ lateralization were related to where and how the whales were feeding in the water column. Smaller rolls (≤180°) predominantly occurred at depth (>70 m), with whales being more likely to rotate clockwise around their longest axis (right lateralized).

  {"id":"frisk_etal19","abstract":"The overexploitation and decline of groundfish populations throughout the 1980s and 1990s resulted in a regime shift on Georges Bank and southern New England, which was characterized by subsequent exponential increases in the observed biomass of Winter Skate Leucoraja ocellata in the region. Recent work suggested that the rate of the Winter Skate biomass increase cannot be fully explained by internal population dynamics of a population without immigration from other regions and/or populations and that adult-mediated population connectivity (AMPC) with neighboring regions is required to fully explain biomass trends. Despite this, no evidence of long-distance dispersal has been observed for Winter Skate, with individuals assumed to display high endemicity to specific regions of the continental shelf. Annual movements of 58 Winter Skate captured off coastal New York were examined using passive acoustic telemetry, revealing seasonal long-distance dispersal capabilities exceeding 1,000 km. In total, 88,783 unique acoustic detections were observed. Telemetered individuals had an average time at liberty of 199.73 d and collectively traveled 17,576.9 km. Individuals tended to migrate south during summer/fall and north during winter/spring. Movement rates of individuals averaged 9.88 km/d (95% confidence interval = 9.25–10.92 km/d) but ranged from 0.13 to 41.38 km/d. An additional 51 recaptured Winter Skate from a total of 3,416 marked with Floy tags suggested greater offshore movement than was observed in acoustically tagged individuals. Our results illustrate that the Winter Skate is a highly mobile species that moves extensively throughout its large geographic range, consistent with its observed ability to rapidly invade neighboring habitat via AMPC. This study has important implications for our understanding of the role of Winter Skate in northwest Atlantic communities and for management strategies therein.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Frisk","given":"Michael G."},{"family":"Shipley","given":"Oliver N."},{"family":"Martinez","given":"Christopher M."},{"family":"McKown","given":"Kim A."},{"family":"Zacharias","given":"Joshua P."},{"family":"Dunton","given":"Keith J."}],"citation-key":"frisk_etal19","container-title":"Marine and Coastal Fisheries","DOI":"10.1002/mcf2.10070","ISSN":"1942-5120","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2019 The Authors.

  {"id":"garland83","abstract":"The Ecological Cost of Transport (ECT) is defined as the percentage of a free-living animal's Daily Energy Expenditure (DEE) that is attributable to transport costs. It is concluded that the ECT must be an increasing function of body mass, with the result that some small mammals may have a very low ECT (<1% DEE) whereas large mammals may have an ECT of 5%-15% or more. For small mammals, or those that move little, daily transport costs would seem to be of little energetic significance. Daily Movement Distance (DMD) scales approximately as M0.25, in contrast to home range area, which scales approximately as M1.0. This discrepancy in scaling exponents is partially explained by a model which relates home range size, stomach capacity, and daily food consumption to yield an estimate of Daily Foraging Distance, the latter being quite similar to the empirically derived equation for DMD. Members of the order Carnivora move an average of 4.4 times as far as other mammals on a daily basis; therefore, Carnivora should spend considerably more on transport costs than do most other mammals. The ECT is discussed in the context of arguments concerning the energetic significance of the cost of locomotion and its relevance to the origin of locomotory specializations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Garland","given":"Theodore"}],"citation-key":"garland83","container-title":"The American Naturalist","ISSN":"0003-0147","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1983]]},"page":"571-587","publisher":"[University of Chicago Press, American Society of Naturalists]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Scaling the Ecological Cost of Transport to Body Mass in Terrestrial Mammals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2460983","volume":"121"},

Most of these aquatic clades are larger bodied, on average, than their closest land-dwelling relatives, but the extent to which potential ecological, biomechanical, and physiological controls contributed to this pattern remains untested quantitatively. Here, we use previously published data on the body masses of 3,859 living and 2,999 fossil mammal species to examine the evolutionary trajectories of body size in aquatic mammals through both comparative phylogenetic analysis and examination of the fossil record. Both methods indicate that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor at ∼500 kg. The existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase. These three independent body size increases and a shared aquatic optimum size are consistent with control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms. Under this energetic model, thermoregulatory costs constrain minimum size, whereas limitations on feeding efficiency constrain maximum size. The optimum size occurs at an intermediate value where thermoregulatory costs are low but feeding efficiency remains high. Rather than being released from size pressures, water-dwelling mammals are driven and confined to larger body sizes by the strict energetic demands of the aquatic medium.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Gearty","given":"William"},{"family":"McClain","given":"Craig R."},{"family":"Payne","given":"Jonathan L."}],"citation-key":"gearty_etal18","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1712629115","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","page":"4194-4199","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Energetic tradeoffs control the size distribution of aquatic mammals","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1712629115","volume":"115"},
  {"id":"geijer_etal16","abstract":"The generally accepted model of Mysticete whale migration is that most individuals undertake seasonal migrations between high and low latitudes. Although numerous exceptions have been described in the literature, the traditional model remains unexamined. This paper represents the first ‘official’ challenge to the traditional model of Mysticete migration. We set out to review the current state of knowledge on the Mediterranean fin whale migratory pattern, and to examine whether the small, resident population in the Mediterranean is an anomaly within the framework of the traditional model of Mysticete migration. We investigated the prevalence of alternative migratory strategies among the Mysticete whales, reviewing the migratory habits of the Mediterranean fin whales and those of other fin whale and baleen whale populations. We reach three main conclusions. First, the seasonal behaviour of the resident Mediterranean fin whales is highly dynamic, and a decade of research has not clarified prevailing uncertainties regarding migration patterns. Second, migration strategies similar to those observed in the Mediterranean fin whales are commonly seen in other populations of baleen whales. Third, the traditional model of whale migration is too simplified to describe the repertoire of Mysticete migratory behaviours accurately. We argue that the paradigm of baleen whale migration warrants further scrutiny to account for more complex movement strategies. We suggest that Mysticete migration should be thought of as a continuum of different strategies that have evolved in the face of different selective pressures. Instead of representing an exception to the rule, the resident Mediterranean fin whales may in fact fall towards one end of a larger spectrum of migratory behaviours. A greater knowledge of ecological factors, reproductive patterns, and local adaptations will be needed to understand the evolutionary mechanisms behind the diversity of migratory habits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Geijer","given":"Christina K.A."},{"family":"Notarbartolo di Sciara","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Panigada","given":"Simone"}],"citation-key":"geijer_etal16","container-title":"Mammal Review","DOI":"10.1111/mam.12069","ISSN":"1365-2907","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2016 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","page":"284-296","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Mysticete migration revisited: are Mediterranean fin whales an anomaly?","title-short":"Mysticete migration revisited","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mam.12069","volume":"46"},
  {"id":"george_etal12","abstract":"A temperature gradient throughout the dominant flight muscle (dorsolongitudinal muscle, DLM1) of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta, together with temperature-dependent muscle contractile rates, demonstrates that significant spatial variation in power production is possible within a single muscle. Using in situ work-loop analyses under varying muscle temperatures and phases of activation, we show that regional differences in muscle temperature will induce a spatial gradient in the mechanical power output throughout the DLM1. Indeed, we note that this power gradient spans from positive to negative values across the predicted temperature range. Warm ventral subunits produce positive power at their in vivo operating temperatures, and therefore act as motors. Concurrently, as muscle temperature decreases dorsally, the subunits produce approximately zero mechanical power output, acting as an elastic energy storage source, and negative power output, behaving as a damper. Adjusting the phase of activation further influences the temperature sensitivity of power output, significantly affecting the mechanical power output gradient that is expressed. Additionally, the separate subregions of the DLM1 did not appear to employ significant physiological compensation for the temperature-induced differences in power output. Thus, although the components of a muscle are commonly thought to operate uniformly, a significant within-muscle temperature gradient has the potential to induce a mechanical power gradient, whereby subunits within a muscle operate with separate and distinct functional roles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"George","given":"N.

  {"id":"gill_etal05","abstract":"Populations of the Bar-tailed Godwit (Limosa lapponica; Scolopacidae) embark on some of the longest migrations known among birds. The baueri race breeds in western Alaska and spends the nonbreeding season a hemisphere away in New Zealand and eastern Australia; the menzbieri race breeds in Siberia and migrates to western and northern Australia. Although the Siberian birds are known to follow the coast of Asia during both migrations, the southern pathway followed by the Alaska breeders has remained unknown. Two questions have particular ecological importance: (1) do Alaska godwits migrate directly across the Pacific, a distance of 11 000 km? and (2) are they capable of doing this in a single flight without stopping to rest or refuel? We explored six lines of evidence to answer these questions. The distribution of resightings of marked birds of the baueri and menzbieri races was significantly different between northward and southward flights with virtually no marked baueri resighted along the Asian mainland during southward migration. The timing of southward migration of the two races further indicates the absence of a coastal Asia route by baueri with peak passage of godwits in general occurring there a month prior to the departure of most birds from Alaska. The use of a direct route across the Pacific is also supported by significantly more records of godwits reported from within a direct migration corridor than elsewhere in Oceania, and during the September to November period than at other times of the year. The annual but rare occurrence of Hudsonian Godwits (L. haemastica) in New Zealand and the absence of their records along the Asian mainland also support a direct flight and are best explained by Hudsonian Godwits accompanying Bar-tailed Godwits from known communal staging areas in Alaska. Flight simulation models, extreme fat loads, and the apparent evolution of a wind-selected migration from Alaska further support a direct, nonstop flight.Atravesando la Barrera Ecológica Final: Evidencia de un Vuelo sin Escala de 11 000 km de Longitud desde Alaska a Nueva Zelanda y el Este de Australia por Limosa lapponicaResumen. Las poblaciones de Limosa lapponica (Scolopacidae) se embarcan en una de las migraciones más largas conocidas para aves. La raza baueri cría en el oeste de Alaska y pasa la estación no reproductiva a un hemisferio de distancia en Nueva Zelanda y el este de Australia; la raza menzbieri cría en Siberia y migra hacia el oeste y el norte de Australia. Aunque se sabe que las aves de Siberia siguen la costa de Asia durante ambas migraciones, la ruta meridional que siguen las aves reproductivas de Alaska ha permanecido desconocida. Dos preguntas tienen particular importancia ecológica: (1) ¿las aves de Alaska migran directamente a través de Pacífico, a lo largo de 11 000 km? y (2) ¿son capaces de hacerlo en un único vuelo sin parar a descansar y reabastecerse? Exploramos seis líneas de evidencia para responder a estas preguntas. La distribución de avistamientos de aves marcadas de las razas baueri y menzbieri fue significativamente diferente entre vuelos hacia el norte y el sur, sin que hubiera prácticamente un solo avistamiento de individuos marcados de baueri a lo largo del continente asiático durante la migración hacia el sur. El período de la migración hacia el sur de ambas razas indica la ausencia de una ruta costera asiática para baueri, con un pico en el paso de las aves ocurriendo allí un mes antes de la partida de la mayoría de las aves desde Alaska. El uso de una ruta directa a través del Pacífico también está avalado por un número significativamente mayor de aves reportadas para un corredor migratorio directo que para cualquier otro lugar de Oceanía, y para el período entre septiembre y noviembre que para otros momentos del año. La presencia anual, aunque rara, de L. haemastica en Nueva Zelanda y la ausencia de registros a lo largo del continente asiático también avalan la posibilidad de un vuelo directo y se explican mejor por el hecho de que L. haemastica acompaña a L. lapponica desde áreas de escala comunes en Alaska. Evidencia complementaria de un vuelo directo sin escalas está dada por modelos de simulación de vuelo, la gran acumulación de grasa en las aves y la aparente evolución de una migración seleccionada por el viento.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Gill","given":"Robert E.","suffix":"Jr."},{"family":"Piersma","given":"Theunis"},{"family":"Hufford","given":"Gary"},{"family":"Servranckx","given":"Rene"},{"family":"Riegen","given":"Adrian"}],"citation-key":"gill_etal05","container-title":"The Condor","container-title-short":"The Condor","DOI":"10.1093/condor/107.1.1","ISSN":"1938-5129","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005]]},"page":"1-20","source":"Silverchair","title":"Crossing the Ultimate Ecological Barrier: Evidence for an 11 000-km-Long Nonstop Flight from Alaska to New Zealand and Eastern Australia by Bar-Tailed Godwits","title-short":"Crossing the Ultimate Ecological Barrier","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/condor/107.1.1","volume":"107"},
  {"id":"gill_etal14","abstract":"The annual 29 000km long migration of the bar-tailed godwit, Limosa lapponica baueri, around the Pacific Ocean traverses what is arguably the most complex and seasonally structured atmospheric setting on Earth. Faced with marked variation in wind regimes and storm conditions across oceanic migration corridors, individuals must make critical decisions about when and where to fly during nonstop flights of a week's duration or longer. At a minimum, their decisions will affect wind profitability and thus reduce energetic costs of migration; in the extreme, poor decisions or unpredictable weather events will risk survival. We used satellite telemetry to track the annual migration of 24 bar-tailed godwits and analysed their flight performance relative to wind conditions during three major migration legs between nonbreeding grounds in New Zealand and breeding grounds in Alaska. Because flight altitudes of birds en route were unknown, we modelled flight efficiency at six geopotential heights across each migratory segment. Birds selected departure dates when atmospheric conditions conferred the greatest wind assistance both at departure and throughout their flights. This behaviour suggests that there exists a cognitive mechanism, heretofore unknown among migratory birds, that allows godwits to assess changes in weather conditions that are linked (i.e. teleconnected) across widely separated atmospheric regions. Godwits also showed adaptive flexibility in their response not only to cues related to seasonal changes in macrometeorology, such as spatial shifting of storm tracks and temporal periods of cyclogenesis, but also to cues associated with stochastic events, especially at departure sites. Godwits showed limits to their response behaviours, however, especially relative to rapidly developing stochastic events while en route. We found that flight efficiency depended significantly upon altitude and hypothesize that godwits exhibit further adaptive flexibility by varying flight altitude en route to optimize flight efficiency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Gill","given":"Robert E."},{"family":"Douglas","given":"David C."},{"family":"Handel","given":"Colleen M."},{"family":"Tibbitts","given":"T.

  {"id":"glazier05","abstract":"In this review I show that the ‘ 3/4-power scaling law ’ of metabolic rate is not universal, either within or among animal species. Signiﬁcant variation in the scaling of metabolic rate with body mass is described mainly for animals, but also for unicells and plants. Much of this variation, which can be related to taxonomic, physiological, and/or environmental diﬀerences, is not adequately explained by existing theoretical models, which are also reviewed. As a result, synthetic explanatory schemes based on multiple boundary constraints and on the scaling of multiple energy-using processes are advocated. It is also stressed that a complete understanding of metabolic scaling will require the identiﬁcation of both proximate (functional) and ultimate (evolutionary) causes. Four major types of intraspeciﬁc metabolic scaling with body mass are recognized [based on the power function R=aMb, where R is respiration (metabolic) rate, a is a constant, M is body mass, and b is the scaling exponent] : Type I: linear, negatively allometric (b<1) ; Type II : linear, isometric (b=1); Type III: nonlinear, ontogenetic shift from isometric (b=1), or nearly isometric, to negatively allometric (b<1) ; and Type IV : nonlinear, ontogenetic shift from positively allometric (b>1) to one or two later phases of negative allometry (b<1). Ontogenetic changes in the metabolic intensity of four component processes (i.e. growth, reproduction, locomotion, and heat production) appear to be important in these diﬀerent patterns of metabolic scaling. These changes may, in turn, be shaped by age (size)-speciﬁc patterns of mortality. In addition, major diﬀerences in interspeciﬁc metabolic scaling are described, especially with respect to mode of temperature regulation, body-size range, and activity level. A ‘metabolic-level boundaries hypothesis ’ focusing on two major constraints (surface-area limits on resource/waste exchange processes and mass/volume limits on power production) can explain much, but not all of this variation. My analysis indicates that further empirical and theoretical work is needed to understand fully the physiological and ecological bases for the considerable variation in metabolic scaling that is observed both within and among species. Recommended approaches for doing this are discussed. I conclude that the scaling of metabolism is not the simple result of a physical law, but rather appears to be the more complex result of diverse adaptations evolved in the context of both physico-chemical and ecological constraints.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Glazier","given":"Douglas S."}],"citation-key":"glazier05","container-title":"Biological Reviews","DOI":"10.1017/S1464793105006834","ISSN":"1464-7931, 1469-185X","issue":"04","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005]]},"language":"en","page":"611","source":"Crossref","title":"Beyond the '3/4-power law': variation in the intra- and interspecific scaling of metabolic rate in animals","title-short":"Beyond the","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1017/S1464793105006834","volume":"80"},
  {"id":"gleiss_etal11","abstract":"1. The energetic costs of different behaviours are critical in modulating the behavioural ecology of free-living animals. Despite this, measurement of energy expenditure in the field has proved difficult. 2. A new method with broad application for field studies has been proposed for determining the rate at which animals expend energy, based on measurements of overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) through the attachment of miniature acceleration data-loggers. This technique is easy to implement and has the promise to be able to resolve energy expenditure with fine (sub-second) temporal resolution, making it the only method which promises to able to determine the cost of short-lived behaviours. Increasing evidence supports the validity of the approach although the rationale behind it is vague. 3. This study explores link between metabolic energy and acceleration by examining what is known about how muscular tissue converts metabolic energy to mechanical work via muscular contraction and how Newtonian physics facilitates a derivation of Power (the rate at which work is performed) from acceleration. The link between metabolic energy and acceleration appears to involve three discrete processes: (i) the ratio of mechanical work to metabolic work performed by a single muscle (mechano-chemical efficiency); (ii) the ratio of external and internal work performed (mechanical work of the limbs in relation to that of the centre of mass); and (iii) the ratio of inertial to de novo mechanical work. These processes may vary according to the animal’s mass, the medium in which it travels and its gait or behaviour. 4. Assessment of movement has limited application in defining non-movement energy expenditure such as that involved in specific dynamic action or non-shivering thermogenesis. However, this non-movement energy expenditure may often be modelled with reasonable confidence. The utility and appropriateness of the ODBA-energy expenditure method depends on a set of conditions, which we define and suggest should be assessed a priori. 5. This study explores the framework behind the ODBA-energy expenditure method to enable informed decisions to be made regarding the suitability for specific research questions addressed, as well as highlighting calibration needs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Gleiss","given":"Adrian C."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Rory P."},{"family":"Shepard","given":"Emily L.

  {"id":"goldbogen_etal07","abstract":"Fin whales Balaenoptera physalus exhibit one of the most extreme feeding methods among aquatic vertebrates. Fin whales, and other rorquals (Balaenopteridae), lunge with their mouth fully agape, thereby generating dynamic pressure to stretch their mouth around a large volume of prey-laden water, which is then filtered by racks of baleen. Despite their large body size, fin whales appear to be limited to short dive durations, likely because of the energetic cost associated with large accelerations of the body during several lunges at depth. Here, we incorporate kinematic data from high-resolution digital tags and morphological data of the engulfment apparatus in a simple mechanical model to estimate the drag acting on a lunge-feeding fin whale. This model also allowed us to quantify the amount of water and prey obtained in a single lunge. Our analysis suggests that the reconfiguration and expansion of the buccal cavity enables an adult fin whale to engulf approximately 60 to 82 m3 of water, a volume greater than its entire body. This large engulfment capacity, however, comes at a high cost because the drag, work against drag, and drag coefficient dramatically increase over the course of a lunge. As a result, kinetic energy is rapidly dissipated from the body, and each subsequent lunge requires acceleration from rest. Despite this high cost, living balaenopterids are not only among the largest animals on earth, but are relatively speciose and exhibit diverse prey preferences. Given this ecological diversity, we frame our results in an evolutionary context, and address the implications of our results for the origin of lunge feeding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Ja"},{"family":"Pyenson","given":"Nd"},{"family":"Shadwick","given":"Re"}],"citation-key":"goldbogen_etal07","container-title":"Marine Ecology Progress Series","DOI":"10.3354/meps07066","ISSN":"0171-8630, 1616-1599","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"en","page":"289-301","source":"Crossref","title":"Big gulps require high drag for fin whale lunge feeding","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v349/p289-301/","volume":"349"},
  {"id":"goldbogen_etal08","abstract":"Lunge feeding in rorqual whales is a drag-based feeding mechanism that is thought to entail a high energetic cost and consequently limit the maximum dive time of these extraordinarily large predators. Although the kinematics of lunge feeding in fin whales supports this hypothesis, it is unclear whether respiratory compensation occurs as a consequence of lunge-feeding activity. We used high-resolution digital tags on foraging humpback whales (Megaptera novaengliae) to determine the number of lunges executed per dive as well as respiratory frequency between dives. Data from two whales are reported, which together performed 58 foraging dives and 451 lunges. During one study, we tracked one tagged whale for approximately 2 h and examined the spatial distribution of prey using a digital echosounder. These data were integrated with the dive profile to reveal that lunges are directed toward the upper boundary of dense krill aggregations. Foraging dives were characterized by a gliding descent, up to 15 lunges at depth, and an ascent powered by steady swimming. Longer dives were required to perform more lunges at depth and these extended apneas were followed by an increase in the number of breaths taken after a dive. Maximum dive durations during foraging were approximately half of those previously reported for singing (i.e. non-feeding) humpback whales. At the highest lunge frequencies (10 to 15 lunges per dive), respiratory rate was at least threefold higher than that of singing humpback whales that underwent a similar degree of apnea. These data suggest that the high energetic cost associated with lunge feeding in blue and fin whales also occurs in intermediate sized rorquals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"J.

Our analysis suggests that, despite the large amount of mechanical work required to lunge feed, a large amount of prey and, therefore, energy is obtained during engulfment. Furthermore, we suggest that foraging efficiency for blue whales is significantly higher than for other marine mammals by nearly an order of magnitude, but only if lunges target extremely high densities of krill. The high predicted efficiency is attributed to the enhanced engulfment capacity, rapid filter rate and low mass-specific metabolic rate associated with large body size in blue whales.

A tag deployed on a buoy in the vicinity of calling fin whales and a recording from a tag that had just fallen off a whale were able to detect calls acoustically but did not record corresponding accelerometer signals that were measured on calling individuals.

  {"id":"goldbogen_etal15","abstract":"Summary\nDespite their importance in determining the rate of both energy gain and expenditure, how the fine-scale kinematics of foraging are modified in response to changes in prey abundance and distribution remain poorly understood in many animal ecosystems.\nIn the marine environment, bulk-filter feeders rely on dense aggregations of prey for energetically efficient foraging. Rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae) exhibit a unique form of filter feeding called lunge feeding, a process whereby discrete volumes of prey-laden water are intermittently engulfed and filtered. In many large rorqual species the size of engulfed water mass is commensurate with the whale's body size, yet is engulfed in just a few seconds. This filter-feeding mode thus requires precise coordination of the body and enlarged engulfment apparatus to maximize capture efficiency.\nPrevious studies from whale-borne tags revealed that many rorqual species perform rolling behaviours when foraging. It has been hypothesized that such acrobatic manoeuvres may be required for efficient prey capture when prey manifest in small discrete patches, but to date there has been no comprehensive analysis of prey patch characteristics during lunge feeding events. We developed a null hypothesis that blue whale kinematics are independent of prey patch characteristics.\nTo test this hypothesis, we investigated the foraging performance of blue whales, the largest filter-feeding predator and their functional response to variability in their sole prey source, krill using a generalized additive mixed model framework. We used a combination of animal-borne movement sensors and hydroacoustic prey mapping to simultaneously quantify the three-dimensional foraging kinematics of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) and the characteristics of targeted krill patches.\nOur analyses rejected our null hypothesis, showing that blue whales performed more acrobatic manoeuvres, including 180° and 360° rolling lunges, when foraging on low-density krill patches. In contrast, whales targeting high-density krill patches involved less manoeuvring during lunges and higher lunge feeding rates.\nThese data demonstrate that blue whales exhibit a range of adaptive foraging strategies that maximize prey capture in different ecological contexts. Because first principles indicate that manoeuvres require more energy compared with straight trajectories, our data reveal a previously unrecognized level of complexity in predator–prey interactions that are not accounted for in optimal foraging and energetic efficiency models.","author":[{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Jeremy A."},{"family":"Hazen","given":"Elliott L."},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari S."},{"family":"Calambokidis","given":"John"},{"family":"DeRuiter","given":"Stacy L."},{"family":"Stimpert","given":"Alison K."},{"family":"Southall","given":"Brandon L."}],"citation-key":"goldbogen_etal15","container-title":"Functional Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2435.12395","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,7,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2146153574","page":"951-961","title":"Prey density and distribution drive the three‐dimensional foraging strategies of the largest filter feeder","type":"article-journal","volume":"29"},

However, the difficulty of studying the world’s largest animals in their natural environment means the functions of anatomical structures must be inferred. Recently, non-invasive tracking devices have been developed that measure body position and orientation, thereby enabling the detailed reconstruction of underwater trajectories. The addition of cameras to the whale-borne tags allows the sensor data to be matched with real-time observations of how whales use their morphological structures, such as flukes, flippers, feeding apparatuses, and blowholes for the physiological functions of locomotion, feeding, and breathing. Here, we describe a new tag design with integrated video and inertial sensors and how it can be used to provide insights to the function of whale anatomy.

  {"id":"goldbogen_etal17a","abstract":"Baleen whales are gigantic obligate ﬁlter feeders that exploit aggregations of small-bodied prey in littoral, epipelagic, and mesopelagic ecosystems. At the extreme of maximum body size observed among mammals, baleen whales exhibit a unique combination of high overall energetic demands and low mass-speciﬁc metabolic rates. As a result, most baleen whale species have evolved ﬁlter-feeding mechanisms and foraging strategies that take advantage of seasonally abundant yet patchily and ephemerally distributed prey resources. New methodologies consisting of multi-sensor tags, active acoustic prey mapping, and hydrodynamic modeling have revolutionized our ability to study the physiology and ecology of baleen whale feeding mechanisms. Here, we review the current state of the ﬁeld by exploring several hypotheses that aim to explain how baleen whales feed. Despite signiﬁcant advances, major questions remain about the processes that underlie these extreme feeding mechanisms, which enabled the evolution of the largest animals of all time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"J.A."},{"family":"Cade","given":"D.E."},{"family":"Calambokidis","given":"J."},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"A.S."},{"family":"Potvin","given":"J."},{"family":"Segre","given":"P.S."},{"family":"Werth","given":"A.J."}],"citation-key":"goldbogen_etal17a","container-title":"Annual Review of Marine Science","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-marine-122414-033905","ISSN":"1941-1405, 1941-0611","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","page":"367-386","source":"Crossref","title":"How Baleen Whales Feed: The Biomechanics of Engulfment and Filtration","title-short":"How Baleen Whales Feed","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-marine-122414-033905","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"goldbogen_etal19a","abstract":"The biology of the blue whale has long fascinated physiologists because of the animal’s extreme size. Despite high energetic demands from a large body, low mass-specific metabolic rates are likely powered by low heart rates. Diving bradycardia should slow blood oxygen depletion and enhance dive time available for foraging at depth. However, blue whales exhibit a high-cost feeding mechanism, lunge feeding, whereby large volumes of prey-laden water are intermittently engulfed and filtered during dives. This paradox of such a large, slowly beating heart and the high cost of lunge feeding represents a unique test of our understanding of cardiac function, hemodynamics, and physiological limits to body size. Here, we used an electrocardiogram (ECG)-depth recorder tag to measure blue whale heart rates during foraging dives as deep as 184 m and as long as 16.5 min. Heart rates during dives were typically 4 to 8 beats min−1 (bpm) and as low as 2 bpm, while after-dive surface heart rates were 25 to 37 bpm, near the estimated maximum heart rate possible. Despite extreme bradycardia, we recorded a 2.5-fold increase above diving heart rate minima during the powered ascent phase of feeding lunges followed by a gradual decrease of heart rate during the prolonged glide as engulfed water is filtered. These heart rate dynamics explain the unique hemodynamic design in rorqual whales consisting of a large-diameter, highly compliant, elastic aortic arch that allows the aorta to accommodate blood ejected by the heart and maintain blood flow during the long and variable pauses between heartbeats.","author":[{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Jeremy A."},{"family":"Cade","given":"David E."},{"family":"Calambokidis","given":"John"},{"family":"Czapanskiy","given":"Max F."},{"family":"Fahlbusch","given":"James A."},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari S."},{"family":"Gough","given":"William T."},{"family":"Kahane-Rapport","given":"Shirel R."},{"family":"Savoca","given":"Matthew S."},{"family":"Ponganis","given":"K.

  {"id":"gough_etal15","abstract":"Common eiders (Somateria mollissima) are heavy sea-ducks that spend a large portion of their time swimming at the water surface. Surface swimming generates a bow and hull wave that can constructively interfere and produce wave drag. The speed at which the wavelengths of these waves equal the waterline length of the swimming animal is the hull speed. To increase surface swimming speed beyond the hull speed, an animal must overtake the bow wave. This study found two distinct behaviors that eider ducks used to exceed the hull speed: (1) ‘steaming’, which involved rapid oaring with the wings to propel the duck along the surface of the water, and (2) ‘paddle-assisted flying’, during which the ducks lifted their bodies out of the water and used their feet to paddle against the surface while flapping their wings in the air. An average hull speed (0.732 ±0.046 m s−1) was calculated for S. mollissima by measuring maximum waterline length from museum specimens. On average, steaming ducks swam 5.5 times faster and paddle-assisted flying ducks moved 6.8 times faster than the hull speed. During steaming, ducks exceeded the hull speed by increasing their body angle and generating dynamic lift to overcome wave drag and hydroplane along the water surface. During paddle-assisted flying, ducks kept their bodies out of the water, thereby avoiding the limitations of wave drag altogether. Both behaviors provided alternatives to flight for these ducks by allowing them to exceed the hull speed while staying at or near the water surface.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Gough","given":"W.

  {"id":"gough_etal18","abstract":"The cetacean tail fluke blades are not supported by any vertebral elements. Instead, the majority of the blades are composed of a densely packed collagenous fiber matrix known as the core layer. Fluke blades from six species of odontocete cetaceans were examined to compare the morphology and orientation of fibers at different locations along the spanwise and chordwise fluke blade axes. The general fiber morphology was consistent with a three-dimensional structure comprised of twodimensional sheets of fibers aligned tightly in a laminated configuration along the spanwise axis. The laminated configuration of the fluke blades helps to maintain spanwise rigidity while allowing partial flexibility during swimming. When viewing the chordwise sectional face at the leading edge and midchord regions, fibers displayed a crossing pattern. This configuration relates to bending and structural support of the fluke blade. The trailing edge core was found to have parallel fibers arranged more dorso-ventrally. The fiber morphology of the fluke blades was dorso-ventrally symmetrical and similar in all species except the pygmy sperm whale (Kogia breviceps), which was found to have additional core layer fiber bundles running along the span of the fluke blade.

  {"id":"gough_etal19","abstract":"The scale dependence of locomotor factors has long been studied in comparative biomechanics, but remains poorly understood for animals at the upper extremes of body size. Rorqual baleen whales include the largest animals, but we lack basic kinematic data about their movements and behavior below the ocean surface. Here, we combined morphometrics from aerial drone photogrammetry, whale-borne inertial sensing tag data and hydrodynamic modeling to study the locomotion of five rorqual species. We quantified changes in tail oscillatory frequency and cruising speed for individual whales spanning a threefold variation in body length, corresponding to an order of magnitude variation in estimated body mass. Our results showed that oscillatory frequency decreases with body length (∝length−0.53) while cruising speed remains roughly invariant (∝length0.08) at 2 m s−1. We compared these measured results for oscillatory frequency against simplified models of an oscillating cantilever beam (∝length−1) and an optimized oscillating Strouhal vortex generator (∝length−1). The difference between our length-scaling exponent and the simplified models suggests that animals are often swimming non-optimally in order to feed or perform other routine behaviors. Cruising speed aligned more closely with an estimate of the optimal speed required to minimize the energetic cost of swimming (∝length0.07). Our results are among the first to elucidate the relationships between both oscillatory frequency and cruising speed and body size for free-swimming animals at the largest scale.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Gough","given":"William T."},{"family":"Segre","given":"Paolo S."},{"family":"Bierlich","given":"K.

  {"id":"gough_etal21","abstract":"High efficiency lunate-tail swimming with high-aspect-ratio lifting surfaces has evolved in many vertebrate lineages, from fish to cetaceans. Baleen whales (Mysticeti) are the largest swimming animals that exhibit this locomotor strategy, and present an ideal study system to examine how morphology and the kinematics of swimming scale to the largest body sizes. We used data from whale-borne inertial sensors coupled with morphometric measurements from aerial drones to calculate the hydrodynamic performance of oscillatory swimming in six baleen whale species ranging in body length from 5 to 25 m (fin whale, Balaenoptera physalus; Bryde's whale, Balaenoptera edeni; sei whale, Balaenoptera borealis; Antarctic minke whale, Balaenoptera bonaerensis; humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae; and blue whale, Balaenoptera musculus). We found that mass-specific thrust increased with both swimming speed and body size. Froude efficiency, defined as the ratio of useful power output to the rate of energy input ( Sloop, 1978), generally increased with swimming speed but decreased on average with increasing body size. This finding is contrary to previous results in smaller animals, where Froude efficiency increased with body size. Although our empirically parameterized estimates for swimming baleen whale drag were higher than those of a simple gliding model, oscillatory locomotion at this scale exhibits generally high Froude efficiency as in other adept swimmers. Our results quantify the fine-scale kinematics and estimate the hydrodynamics of routine and energetically expensive swimming modes at the largest scale.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Gough","given":"William T."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Hayden J."},{"family":"Savoca","given":"Matthew S."},{"family":"Czapanskiy","given":"Max F."},{"family":"Fish","given":"Frank E."},{"family":"Potvin","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Bierlich","given":"K.

  {"id":"gough_etal22","abstract":"Although gigantic body size and obligate filter feeding mechanisms have evolved in multiple vertebrate lineages (mammals and fishes), intermittent ram (lunge) filter feeding is unique to a specific family of baleen whales: rorquals. Lunge feeding is a high cost, high benefit feeding mechanism that requires the integration of unsteady locomotion (i.e., accelerations and maneuvers); the impact of scale on the biomechanics and energetics of this foraging mode continues to be the subject of intense study. The goal of our investigation was to use a combination of multi-sensor tags paired with UAS footage to determine the impact of morphometrics such as body size on kinematic lunging parameters such as fluking timing, maximum lunging speed, and deceleration during the engulfment period for a range of species from minke to blue whales. Our results show that, in the case of krill-feeding lunges and regardless of size, animals exhibit a skewed gradient between powered and fully unpowered engulfment, with fluking generally ending at the point of both the maximum lunging speed and mouth opening. In all cases, the small amounts of propulsive thrust generated by the tail were unable to overcome the high drag forces experienced during engulfment. Assuming this thrust to be minimal, we predicted the minimum speed of lunging across scale. To minimize the energetic cost of lunge feeding, hydrodynamic theory predicts slower lunge feeding speeds regardless of body size, with a lower boundary set by the ability of the prey to avoid capture. We used empirical data to test this theory and instead found that maximum foraging speeds remain constant and high (∼4 m s–1) across body size, even as higher speeds result in lower foraging efficiency. Regardless, we found an increasing relationship between body size and this foraging efficiency, estimated as the ratio of energetic gain from prey to energetic cost. This trend held across timescales ranging from a single lunge to a single day and suggests that larger whales are capturing more prey—and more energy—at a lower cost.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Gough","given":"William T"},{"family":"Cade","given":"David E"},{"family":"Czapanskiy","given":"Max F"},{"family":"Potvin","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Fish","given":"Frank E"},{"family":"Kahane-Rapport","given":"Shirel R"},{"family":"Savoca","given":"Matthew S"},{"family":"Bierlich","given":"K C"},{"family":"Johnston","given":"David W"},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari S"},{"family":"Szabo","given":"Andy"},{"family":"Bejder","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Jeremy A"}],"citation-key":"gough_etal22","container-title":"Integrative Organismal Biology","container-title-short":"Integrative Organismal Biology","DOI":"10.1093/iob/obac038","ISSN":"2517-4843","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"license":"All rights reserved","page":"obac038","source":"Silverchair","title":"Fast and Furious: Energetic Tradeoffs and Scaling of High-Speed Foraging in Rorqual Whales","title-short":"Fast and Furious","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/iob/obac038","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"gough_mcguire15","abstract":"Motor laterality is the preference shown for using one limb or lateral half of the body over the other. In domestic dogs, most laterality studies have examined forelimb preferences during staged tasks. We focused instead on hindlimb preferences during urination when males use the raised-leg posture and females the squat-raise. We observed individual dogs during walks at two shelters (Tompkins County SPCA and Cortland Community SPCA) and recorded posture used for each urination and hindlimb raised, if any. First, we examined whether raising a hindlimb during urination varied with sex, age class, or reproductive status (females, anestrous intact or spayed; males, intact or neutered). Second, for dogs that raised a hindlimb during urination, we determined whether a population bias existed. Finally, for dogs with at least 10 urinations in which a hindlimb was raised, we examined whether a signiﬁcant hindlimb preference existed. For some analyses, we had sufﬁcient dogs at only one shelter. We found that males were more likely than females to raise a hindlimb during urination (P < 0.0001 at each shelter), and that propensity to raise a hindlimb was unaffected by reproductive status (P = 0.82, Cortland). Seniors were more likely than adults, which, in turn, were more likely than juveniles, to raise a hindlimb during urination (P < 0.0001, Tompkins). We found no evidence of a population bias with respect to hindlimb raised at either shelter (% of hindlimb raises involving the right hindlimb: 53%, Tompkins; 43%, Cortland). Of the dogs that met the criterion for at least 10 urinations with a raised hindlimb, most were ambilateral (83%, Tompkins; 90%, Cortland). Our study conﬁrms and extends for shelter dogs the effects of sex and age on urinary postures previously reported for dogs living under other conditions; to our knowledge, the increased likelihood of raising a hindlimb during urination that characterized seniors (males, 91%; females, 25%) when compared to adults (males, 73%; females, 6%) has not been reported previously. Lack of a population bias with respect to hindlimb raised is consistent with ﬁndings of most motor laterality studies in dogs. However, our ﬁnding that most dogs were ambilateral differs from results obtained from studies using staged forelimb tasks. Assessing motor laterality for a natural hindlimb behavior in dogs during walks has both advantages and disadvantages, which include ease of observation during a positive experience for the dog and the challenge of obtaining sufﬁcient scores for each dog.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Gough","given":"William"},{"family":"McGuire","given":"Betty"}],"citation-key":"gough_mcguire15","container-title":"Applied Animal Behaviour Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.applanim.2015.04.006","ISSN":"01681591","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","license":"All rights reserved","page":"61-70","source":"Crossref","title":"Urinary posture and motor laterality in dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) at two shelters","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168159115001203","volume":"168"},
  {"id":"graham_etal90","abstract":"A large, sea-going water tunnel was used in various studies of shark swimming performance. The critical swimming velocity (UCTil, an index of aerobically sustainable swimming speed) of a 70 cm long lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris Poey) was determined to be 1.1 Ls\"1, where L is body length. The Umt of the leopard shark {Triakis semifasciata Girard) was found to vary inversely with body size; from about 1.6Ls-1 in 30-50cm sharks to 0.6LS\"1 in 120cm sharks. Large Triakis adopt ram gill ventilation at swimming speeds between 27 and 60cms\"1, which is similar to the speed at which this transition occurs in teleosts. Analyses of tail-beat frequency (TBF) in relation to velocity and body size show that smaller Triakis have a higher TBF and can swim at higher relative speeds. TBF, however, approaches a maximal value at speeds approaching U^, suggesting that red muscle contraction velocity may limit sustained swimming speed. The TBF of both Triakis and Negaprion rises at a faster rate with swimming velocity than does that of the more thunniform mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus Rafinesque). This is consistent with the expectation that, at comparable relative speeds, sharks adapted for efficient swimming should have a lower TBF. The rates of O2 consumption of swimming lemon and mako sharks are among the highest yet measured for elasmobranchs and are comparable to those of cruise-adapted teleosts.","author":[{"family":"Graham","given":"Jeffrey B"},{"family":"Dewar","given":"Heidi"},{"family":"Lai","given":"N C"},{"family":"Lowell","given":"William R"},{"family":"Arce","given":"Steve M"}],"citation-key":"graham_etal90","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Biology","issued":{"date-parts":[[1990]]},"language":"en","page":"18","source":"Zotero","title":"Aspects of shark swimming performance determined using a large water tunnel","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"groot_etal23","abstract":"The identification of patterns in trait evolution is essential to understand the interaction of evolutionary forces, and provides useful information for species management. Cetaceans are a phylogenetically well-resolved infraorder that exhibit distinct trait variation across behavioral, molecular, and life history dimensions, yet few researchers have applied a meta-analytic or comparative approach to these traits. To understand cetacean trait evolution, we used a phylogenetic generalized least squares approach to examine the cognitive buffer hypothesis (CBH). A large brain should buffer individuals against environmental challenges through increasing survival rates, and a longer lifespan should buffer individuals against the cost of extended development for larger brains according to the CBH, leading to an expected positive correlation between brain size and lifespan. In contrast to this expectation, previously observed in taxa including primates, we found a negative correlation between brain size and lifespan in cetaceans. This suggests cetaceans experience selective pressures different from most other mammals in these traits but may be more similar to some social mammalian carnivores that display alloparenting. We also provide a comprehensive dataset to explore additional aspects of trait evolution but which would greatly benefit from studies on behavioral ecology across cetaceans and increased focus on data deficient species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Groot","given":"Nikita E"},{"family":"Constantine","given":"Rochelle"},{"family":"Garland","given":"Ellen C"},{"family":"Carroll","given":"Emma L"}],"citation-key":"groot_etal23","container-title":"Evolution","container-title-short":"Evolution","DOI":"10.1093/evolut/qpac050","ISSN":"0014-3820","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,1]]},"page":"534-549","source":"Silverchair","title":"Phylogenetically controlled life history trait meta-analysis in cetaceans reveals unexpected negative brain size and longevity correlation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/evolut/qpac050","volume":"77"},
  {"id":"guilpin_etal19","abstract":"Foraging efficiency (FE) is determined by the ratio of energy intake to energy expenditure and represents a metric for estimating the capacity to store energy. Blue whales Balaenoptera musculus rely mostly on stored energy reserves for reproduction. They feed almost exclusively on krill, which vary in density and abundance both spatially and temporally. We used 10 depth−velocity archival tags deployed on blue whales foraging in the St. Lawrence Estuary, Canada, to identify feeding events. We modeled krill densities required to equal or exceed energy expenditures and allow energy storage. During the daytime, blue whales generally dove deeper and performed fewer but longer feeding dives than at other times of the diel cycle (10 vs. 28 feeding dives h−1); however, they performed more lunges per dive during daytime (3 vs. 1 lunge dive−1), which resulted in a stable feeding rate around the clock. Only 11.7 and 5.5% of the Arctic and northern krill patches measured in situ contained densities allowing blue whales to achieve neutral energetic balance (FE = 1); less than 1.5% of patches allowed FE of ³3. While FE leading to successful reproduction and adequate fitness is unknown, these results underscore the necessity for blue whales to seek the highest densities within patches to reach neutral balance or allow energy storage. These findings further our understanding of blue whale foraging ecology and habitat suitability, and may help predict the effects of climate and natural variability or of potential fisheries on krill densities and blue whale condition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Guilpin","given":"M"},{"family":"Lesage","given":"V"},{"family":"McQuinn","given":"I"},{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Ja"},{"family":"Potvin","given":"J"},{"family":"Jeanniard-du-Dot","given":"T"},{"family":"Doniol-Valcroze","given":"T"},{"family":"Michaud","given":"R"},{"family":"Moisan","given":"M"},{"family":"Winkler","given":"G"}],"citation-key":"guilpin_etal19","container-title":"Marine Ecology Progress Series","container-title-short":"Mar.

  {"id":"hamilton_etal04","abstract":"This study investigated the functional morphology of the blubber that forms the caudal keels of the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). Blubber is a pliant biocomposite formed by adipocytes and structural fibers composed of collagen and elastic fibers. Caudal keels are dorsally and ventrally placed triangular wedges of blubber that define the hydrodynamic profile of the porpoise tailstock. Mechanical tests on carcasses demonstrate that when keels are bent, they strain nonuniformly along their lengths, with highest strains just caudal to the dorsal fin and lowest at the insertion of the flukes. Therefore, caudal keels undergo nonuniform longitudinal deformation while maintaining a stable, triangular cross-sectional shape. Polarizing and transmitted light microscopy techniques were used to investigate blubber's 3D fiber architecture along the length of the dorsal keel. The triangular cross-sectional shape of the keel appears to be maintained by structural fibers oriented to act as tensile stays. The construction of the blubber composite is regionally specific :structural fiber densities and diameters are higher in the relatively stiff caudal region of the keel than in the more deformable cranial keel region. The orientations of structural fibers also change along the length of the keel. Cranially, no fibers are oriented along the long axis, whereas a novel population of longitudinally oriented fibers reinforces the keel at the insertion of the flukes. Thus, differences in the distribution and orientation of structural fibers contribute to the regionally specific mechanical properties of the dorsal keel. J.

The differences in life histories are particularly striking. Compared with placentals, marsupials exhibit shorter pregnancy, smaller size of offspring at birth and longer period of lactation in the pouch. Monotremes also exhibit short pregnancy, but incubate embryos in eggs, followed by a long period of post-hatching lactation. Using a large sample of mammalian species, we show that, remarkably, despite their very different life histories, the scaling of production rates is statistically indistinguishable across mammalian lineages. Apparently all mammals are subject to the same fundamental metabolic constraints on productivity, because they share similar body designs, vascular systems and costs of producing new tissue.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hamilton","given":"Marcus J."},{"family":"Davidson","given":"Ana D."},{"family":"Sibly","given":"Richard M."},{"family":"Brown","given":"James H."}],"citation-key":"hamilton_etal10","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2010.1056","issue":"1705","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,8,25]]},"page":"560-566","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Universal scaling of production rates across mammalian lineages","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2010.1056","volume":"278"},

Euphausiids almost always occurred within the confines of dense schools swimming in one direction. Schools formed an infinite variety of shapes but usually were narrow in at least one dimension, so that individuals within a school were never far from its edge. Schools moved at about 20 cm/s, primarily horizontally, and vertical displacement was always accompanied by much larger horizontal excursions. Opaque, presumably necrotic, euphausiids occurred within schools, indicating that schooling may have epidemiologic disadvantages. Schools exhibited a variety of behavioral responses to potential and actual predators (sea birds and whales). A hypothesis of ontogenetic differences in schooling behavior proposes that juveniles migrate long distances horizontally in search of food over both shallow and deep waters, but that schools of adults spawn in or near deep water so that rapidly sinking eggs are not deposited on the sea bed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Hamner","given":"William M."}],"citation-key":"hamner84","container-title":"Journal of Crustacean Biology","DOI":"10.1163/1937240X84X00507","ISSN":"0278-0372, 1937-240X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[1984]]},"language":"en","page":"67-74","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Aspects of Schooling in Euphausia Superba","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://academic.oup.com/jcb/article/4/5/67/2328286/Aspects-of-Schooling-in-Euphausia-Superba","volume":"4"},

For swimming fish, the energy expended to travel a unit distance, or cost of transport (COT), has a U-shaped relationship to speed. The relationship between propulsive kinematics and speed, summarized by the Strouhal number (St=fA/U, where f is tail beat frequency, A is tail tip amplitude in m and U is swimming speed in m s−1), allows for maximal propulsive efficiency where 0.2<St<0.4. Largemouth bass adopted field speeds that were generally below the range predicted to minimize their COT. This may reflect speed modulation to meet competing functional demands such as enabling effective prey detection and capture. St exceeded the optimal range for the lowest observed swimming speeds.

  {"id":"hansen_etal","abstract":"Group-hunting is ubiquitous across animal taxa and has received considerable attention in the context of its functions. By contrast much less is known about the mechanisms by which grouping predators hunt their prey. This is primarily due to a lack of experimental manipulation alongside logistical difficulties quantifying the behaviour of multiple predators at high spatiotemporal resolution as they search, select, and capture wild prey. However, the use of new remote-sensing technologies and a broadening of the focal taxa beyond apex predators provides researchers with a great opportunity to discern accurately how multiple predators hunt together and not just whether doing so provides hunters with a per capita benefit. We incorporate many ideas from collective behaviour and locomotion throughout this review to make testable predictions for future researchers and pay particular attention to the role that computer simulation can play in a feedback loop with empirical data collection. Our review of the literature showed that the breadth of predator:prey size ratios among the taxa that can be considered to hunt as a group is very large (<100 to >102). We therefore synthesised the literature with respect to these predator:prey ratios and found that they promoted different hunting mechanisms. Additionally, these different hunting mechanisms are also related to particular stages of the hunt (search, selection, capture) and thus we structure our review in accordance with these two factors (stage of the hunt and predator:prey size ratio). We identify several novel group-hunting mechanisms which are largely untested, particularly under field conditions, and we also highlight a range of potential study organisms that are amenable to experimental testing of these mechanisms in connection with tracking technology. We believe that a combination of new hypotheses, study systems and methodological approaches should help push the field of group-hunting in new directions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hansen","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Domenici","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Bartashevich","given":"Palina"},{"family":"Burns","given":"Alicia"},{"family":"Krause","given":"Jens"}],"citation-key":"hansen_etal","container-title":"Biological Reviews","DOI":"10.1111/brv.12973","ISSN":"1469-185X","issue":"n/a","language":"en","license":"© 2023 The Authors.

Satellite-linked biologgers and networks of acoustic receivers allow animals to be reliably monitored over scales of tens of meters to thousands of kilometers, giving insight into their habitat use, home range size, the phenology of migratory patterns and the biotic and abiotic factors that drive their distributions. Furthermore, physical environmental variables can be collected using animals as autonomous sampling platforms, increasing spatial and temporal coverage of global oceanographic observation systems. The use of animal telemetry, therefore, has the capacity to provide measures from a suite of essential ocean variables (EOVs) for improved monitoring of Earth's oceans. Here we outline the design features of animal telemetry systems, describe current applications and their benefits and challenges, and discuss future directions. We describe new analytical techniques that improve our ability to not only quantify animal movements but to also provide a powerful framework for comparative studies across taxa. We discuss the application of animal telemetry and its capacity to collect biotic and abiotic data, how the data collected can be incorporated into ocean observing systems, and the role these data can play in improved ocean management.","author":[{"family":"Harcourt","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Sequeira","given":"Ana M.

Eight of these elephants were observed using branches presumably to repel flies. In the second part of the study, conducted also in Nagarhole Park, we presented to 13 captive elephants, maintained under a naturalistic system, branches that were too long or bushy to be effectively used as switches. The long branches were presented in two trials to each elephant and they were given 5min to either attempt switching with the long branch, or modify the branch and switch with the altered branch. Eight of these elephants modified the branch on at least one trial to a smaller branch and switched with the altered branch. There were different styles of modification of the branches, the most common of which was holding the main stem with the front foot and pulling off a side branch or distal end with the trunk. We propose that fly switching with branches is a common form of tool use in wild Asian elephants when fly intensity is high. Our documentation of the manufacture of a tool by elephants, together with the fact that these animals have a volume of cerebral cortex available for cognitive processing that exceeds that of any primate species, would appear to place this animal in the category of great apes in terms of cognitive abilities for tool use and tool manufacture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Hart","given":"Benjamin L."},{"family":"Hart","given":"Lynette A."},{"family":"McCoy","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Sarath","given":"C.

  {"id":"hart_etal08","abstract":"Among terrestrial mammals, elephants share the unique status, along with humans and great apes, of having large brains, being long-lived and having offspring that require long periods of dependency. Elephants have the largest brains of all terrestrial mammals, including the greatest volume of cerebral cortex. In contrast to what one might expect from such a large-brained species, the performance of elephants in cognitive feats, such as tool use, visual discrimination learning and tests of “insight” behavior, is unimpressive in comparison to the performance by chimpanzees and, of course, humans. Where elephants do seem to excel is in long-term, extensive spatial-temporal and social memory. In addition, elephants appear to be somewhat unique among non-human species in their reactions to disabled and deceased conspecifics, exhibiting behaviors that are mindful of “theory-of-mind” phenomena. Information gleaned from studies on the neural cytoarchitecture of large brains reveals that the neurons of the cerebral cortex of elephants are much less densely populated than in large-brained primates. The interactions between cortical neurons would appear to be more global and less compartmentalized into local areas, and cortical information processing slower, than in great apes and humans. Although focused neural cytoarchitecture studies on the elephant are needed, this comparative perspective on the cortical neural cytoarchitecture appears to relate to differences in behavior between elephants and their primate counterparts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Hart","given":"Benjamin L."},{"family":"Hart","given":"Lynette A."},{"family":"Pinter-Wollman","given":"Noa"}],"citation-key":"hart_etal08","container-title":"Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews","container-title-short":"Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews","DOI":"10.1016/j.neubiorev.2007.05.012","ISSN":"0149-7634","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"language":"en","page":"86-98","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Large brains and cognition: Where do elephants fit in?","title-short":"Large brains and cognition","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014976340700070X","volume":"32"},

  {"id":"hassel_etal22","abstract":"Satellite telemetry is a powerful method to study the movements and habitat use of cetaceans. The deployment of transmitters is usually conducted using remote techniques and involves close approaches to the target animals. The present study reports on an accidental collision between a female humpback whale and an inflatable boat, which occurred on 7 October 2010 off the coast of Brazil. At the time of the accident, the boat was occupied by four crew members: the tagger, the photographer, the driver and an observer. This collision resulted in head trauma and severe brain injury to the photographer. It also resulted in changes of the tagging deployment procedures and the implementation of a Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) management system. The objective of this work is to report on this accident and describe procedures adopted to assess and minimise risks. Changes and updates in deployment protocols are viewed as improvements to minimise accidents during marine mammal tagging operations. Some of these improvements were also discussed and implemented by other organisations. Accidents such as the one reported here can and should be prevented. However, when they occur, they provide an opportunity to assess and correct unanticipated deficiencies in field work procedures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Hassel","given":"Lucas B."},{"family":"Zerbini","given":"Alexandre Novaes"},{"family":"Andriolo","given":"Artur"},{"family":"Cabete","given":"Ricardo"}],"citation-key":"hassel_etal22","container-title":"J.

  {"id":"hayward_etal06","abstract":"Leopards Panthera pardus have a catholic diet and are generally thought to prey on medium-sized ungulates; however, knowledge on which species are actually preferred and avoided is lacking, along with an understanding of why such preferences arise. Twenty-nine published and four unpublished studies of leopard diet that had relative prey abundance estimates associated with them were analysed from 13 countries in 41 different spatial locations or temporal periods throughout the distribution of the leopard. A Jacobs' index value was calculated for each prey species in each study and the mean of these was then tested against a mean of 0 using t or sign tests for preference or avoidance. Leopards preferentially prey upon species within a weight range of 10–40 kg. Regression plots suggest that the most preferred mass of leopard prey is 25 kg, whereas the mean body mass of significantly preferred prey is 23 kg. Leopards prefer prey within this body mass range, which occur in small herds, in dense habitat and afford the hunter minimal risk of injury during capture. Consequently, impala, bushbuck and common duiker are significantly preferred, with chital likely to also be preferred with a larger sample size from Asian sites. Species outside the preferred weight range are generally avoided, as are species that are restricted to open vegetation or that have sufficient anti-predator strategies. The ratio of mean leopard body mass with that of their preferred prey is less than 1 and may be a reflection of their solitary hunting strategy. This model will allow us to predict the diet of leopards in areas where dietary information is lacking, also providing information to assist wildlife managers and conservation bodies on predator carrying capacity and predator–prey interactions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hayward","given":"M.

  {"id":"hayward_kerley05","abstract":"Lions Panthera leo are generally thought to prey on medium to large ungulates. Knowledge of which species are actually preferred and which are avoided is lacking, however, as is an understanding of why such preference or avoidance may arise. An analysis of 32 studies over 48 different spatial locations or temporal periods throughout the distribution of the lion shows that it preferentially preys upon species within a weight range of 190–550 kg. The most preferred weight of lion prey is 350 kg. The mean mass of signiﬁcantly preferred prey species is 290 kg and of all preferred species is 201 kg. Gemsbok, buffalo, wildebeest, giraffe and zebra are signiﬁcantly preferred. Species outside the preferred weight range are generally avoided. Species within the preferred weight range that are not signiﬁcantly preferred (such as roan, sable and eland) generally have features that reduce predation either morphologically (e.g. sable horns), ecologically (e.g. roan and sable occurring at low density), or behaviourally (e.g. the large herd size and increased vigilance of eland). Warthog are below the preferred weight range yet are taken in accordance with their availability and this is probably due to their sympatry with lion, their relatively slow evasion speed and their lower level of vigilance. Plots of prey preference against prey body mass follows a bell curve with a right skew that, we argue, is caused by collective hunting by lions of larger-bodied prey. Our methods can be used on all large predators and are likely to be useful in assessing competition in sympatric communities of predators, cooperative hunting and predicting predator diets. This will allow us to move beyond descriptive dietary studies to improve our predictive understanding of the mechanisms underlying predator–prey interactions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hayward","given":"Matt W."},{"family":"Kerley","given":"Graham I.

  {"id":"hazen_etal12","abstract":"The field of marine tagging and tracking has grown rapidly in recent years as tag sizes have decreased and the diversity of sensors has increased. Tag data provide a unique view on individual movement patterns, at different scales than shipboard surveys, and have been used to discover new habitat areas, characterize oceanographic features, and delineate stock structures, among other purposes. Due to the necessity for small tag-to-body size ratio, tags have largely been deployed on adult animals, resulting in a relative paucity of data on earlier life history stages. In this study, we reviewed tagging efforts on multiple life history stages for seabirds, marine mammals, marine turtles, and fish and enumerated studies focusing on each guild that targeted larvae, juveniles or hatchlings. We found that turtles and fish had higher proportion of studies focusing on juveniles (> 20%) than seabirds and marine mammals (<10%). On both juveniles and adults, tags were used in a targeted manner with passive and transmitting tags as the main tools for population demography and connectivity studies, while GPS and archival tags were used more frequently for habitat analyses and foraging ecology. These findings identify the need to focus on novel approaches in tagging multiple life history stages both to study marine predator ecology and to effectively manage marine populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Hazen","given":"El"},{"family":"Maxwell","given":"Sm"},{"family":"Bailey","given":"H"},{"family":"Bograd","given":"Sj"},{"family":"Hamann","given":"M"},{"family":"Gaspar","given":"P"},{"family":"Godley","given":"Bj"},{"family":"Shillinger","given":"Gl"}],"citation-key":"hazen_etal12","container-title":"Marine Ecology Progress Series","container-title-short":"Mar.

Because use of the terms “ecosystem sentinel” and “climate sentinel” has proliferated in the scientific literature, there is a need to identify the properties that make marine predators effective sentinels. We provide a clear definition of the term “sentinel”, review the attributes of species identified as sentinels, and describe how a suite of such sentinels could strengthen our understanding and management of marine ecosystems.

We hypothesized that differences in BMR allometry would be reflected in similar differences in scaling of O2 delivery pathways through the cardiorespiratory system. We performed a comparative analysis of BMR across 63 mammalian species (20 aquatic, 43 terrestrial) with a Mb range from 10 kg to 5318 kg. Our results revealed elevated BMRs in small (>10 kg and <100 kg) aquatic mammals compared to small terrestrial mammals. The results demonstrated that minute ventilation, that is, tidal volume (VT)·breathing frequency (fR), as well as cardiac output, that is, stroke volume·heart rate, do not differ between the two habitats. We found that the “aquatic breathing strategy”, characterized by higher VT and lower fR resulting in a more effective gas exchange, and by elevated blood hemoglobin concentrations resulting in a higher volume of O2 for the same volume of blood, supported elevated metabolic requirements in aquatic mammals. The results from this study provide a possible explanation of how differences in gas exchange may serve energy demands in aquatic versus terrestrial mammals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,8]]},"author":[{"family":"He","given":"Rebecca S."},{"family":"De Ruiter","given":"Stacy"},{"family":"Westover","given":"Tristan"},{"family":"Somarelli","given":"Jason A."},{"family":"Blawas","given":"Ashley M."},{"family":"Dayanidhi","given":"Divya L."},{"family":"Singh","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Steves","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Driesinga","given":"Samantha"},{"family":"Halsey","given":"Lewis G."},{"family":"Fahlman","given":"Andreas"}],"citation-key":"he_etal23","container-title":"Physiological Reports","DOI":"10.14814/phy2.15698","ISSN":"2051-817X","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2023 The Authors.

  {"id":"hedenstrom03","abstract":"Overall migration speed is likely to be a trait under selection pressure in animals migrating annually between habitats for reproduction and survival. A general expression was used for migration speed (V migr), accounting for energy accumulation and transport, and derive how V migr scales with body mass for three types of migratory locomotion: running, swimming and ﬂying (powered and soaring ﬂight). Migration speed is predicted to increase with increasing body mass in animals that run (∝m1/11), swim (∝m1/24) and ﬂy by soaring (∝m0.22), whereas in animals migrating by powered ﬂight it decreases (∝m−1/4). How the relative duration of fuel accumulation to that of migratory locomotion scales with body mass is also derived. This proportion should increase in animals that run and ﬂy, but should remain unaffected by body size in swimmers. The suggestion is made that in runners and swimmers, selection for enhanced migration speed could provide an explanation to Cope’s rule, i.e. the observation that body size gradually tends to increase over time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Hedenström","given":"Anders"}],"citation-key":"hedenstrom03","container-title":"Journal of Zoology","container-title-short":"Journal of Zoology","DOI":"10.1017/S0952836902003096","ISSN":"0952-8369, 1469-7998","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"language":"en","page":"155-160","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Scaling migration speed in animals that run, swim and fly","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1017/S0952836902003096","volume":"259"},

  {"id":"hein_etal12","abstract":"Animal migration is one of the great wonders of nature, but the factors that determine how far migrants travel remain poorly understood. We present a new quantitative model of animal migration and use it to describe the maximum migration distance of walking, swimming and ﬂying migrants. The model combines biomechanics and metabolic scaling to show how maximum migration distance is constrained by body size for each mode of travel. The model also indicates that the number of body lengths travelled by walking and swimming migrants should be approximately invariant of body size. Data from over 200 species of migratory birds, mammals, ﬁsh, and invertebrates support the central conclusion of the model – that body size drives variation in maximum migration distance among species through its effects on metabolism and the cost of locomotion. The model provides a new tool to enhance general understanding of the ecology and evolution of migration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Hein","given":"Andrew M."},{"family":"Hou","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Gillooly","given":"James F."}],"citation-key":"hein_etal12","container-title":"Ecology Letters","DOI":"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01714.x","ISSN":"1461023X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","page":"104-110","source":"Crossref","title":"Energetic and biomechanical constraints on animal migration distance","title-short":"Energetic and biomechanical constraints on animal migration distance","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01714.x","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"higham07","abstract":"For most vertebrates, locomotion is a fundamental component of prey capture. Despite this ubiquitous link, few studies have quantified the integration of these complex systems. Several variables related to locomotor performance, including maximum speed, acceleration, deceleration, maneuverability, accuracy, and approach stability, likely influence feeding performance in vertebrates. The relative importance of these measures of performance, however, depends on the ecology of the predator. While factors such as morphology and physiology likely define the limits of these variables, other factors such as motivation of the predator, prey type, and habitat structure can also influence performance. Understanding how these variables relate to feeding under a given suite of ecological conditions is central to understanding predator–prey interactions, and ultimately how locomotion and feeding have co-evolved. The goals of this article are to discuss several variables of locomotor performance related to prey capture, present new data on the relationship between locomotor and feeding morphology in fishes, discuss the evolution of prey capture in cichlid fishes, and outline some future directions for research. While suction feeding is a primary mechanism of prey capture in fishes, swimming is vital for accurately positioning the mouth relative to the prey item. Many fishes decelerate during prey capture using their body and fins, but the pectoral fins have a dominant role in maintaining approach stability. This suggests that fishes employing high-performance suction feeding (relatively small mouth) will have larger pectoral fins to facilitate accurate and stable feeding. I provide new data on the relationship between pectoral fin morphology and maximum gape in centrarchid fishes. For seven species, pectoral fin area was significantly, and negatively, correlated with maximum gape. This example illustrates that the demands from one complex system (feeding) can influence another complex system (locomotion). Future studies that examine the morphological, physiological, and functional evolution of locomotion involved in prey capture by aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates will provide insight into the origin and consequences of diversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Higham","given":"Timothy E."}],"citation-key":"higham07","container-title":"Integrative and Comparative Biology","container-title-short":"Integrative and Comparative Biology","DOI":"10.1093/icb/icm021","ISSN":"1540-7063","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"page":"82-95","source":"Silverchair","title":"The integration of locomotion and prey capture in vertebrates: Morphology, behavior, and performance","title-short":"The integration of locomotion and prey capture in vertebrates","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/icm021","volume":"47"},

The model takes account of both hydrodynamic and thermal processes. The thermal component incorporates both free and forced convection and takes account of the effect of hair on free convection. Using data from the literature to evaluate all but two of the parameters, we apply the model to metabolic rate data on phocid seals, otariids (sea lions), penguins and minke whales. We show that the model is able to reproduce two unusual features of the data; namely, a very rapid increase in metabolic rate at low velocities and an overall rise in metabolic rate with velocity which is slower than the rise in hydrodynamic drag force. The work shows the metabolic costs of propulsion and thermoregulation in a swimming homeotherm to be interlinked and suggests differing costs of propulsion for different modes of swimming. This is potentially of ecological significance since the swimming speed that minimises the cost of transport for an animal will change with changes in water temperature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Hind","given":"A.

  {"id":"hindell_etal16","abstract":"In the Southern Ocean, wide-ranging predators offer the opportunity to quantify how animals respond to differences in the environment because their behavior and population trends are an integrated signal of prevailing conditions within multiple marine habitats. Southern elephant seals in particular, can provide useful insights due to their circumpolar distribution, their long and distant migrations and their performance of extended bouts of deep diving. Furthermore, across their range, elephant seal populations have very different population trends. In this study, we present a data set from the International Polar Year project; Marine Mammals Exploring the Oceans Pole to Pole for southern elephant seals, in which a large number of instruments (N = 287) deployed on animals, encompassing a broad circum-Antarctic geographic extent, collected in situ ocean data and at-sea foraging metrics that explicitly link foraging behavior and habitat structure in time and space. Broadly speaking, the seals foraged in two habitats, the relatively shallow waters of the Antarctic continental shelf and the Kerguelen Plateau and deep open water regions. Animals of both sexes were more likely to exhibit area-restricted search (ARS) behavior rather than transit in shelf habitats. While Antarctic shelf waters can be regarded as prime habitat for both sexes, female seals tend to move northwards with the advance of sea ice in the late autumn or early winter. The water masses used by the seals also influenced their behavioral mode, with female ARS behavior being most likely in modified Circumpolar Deepwater or northerly Modified Shelf Water, both of which tend to be associated with the outer reaches of the Antarctic Continental Shelf. The combined effects of (1) the differing habitat quality, (2) differing responses to encroaching ice as the winter progresses among colonies, (3) differing distances between breeding and haul-out sites and high quality habitats, and (4) differing long-term regional trends in sea ice extent can explain the differing population trends observed among elephant seal colonies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Hindell","given":"Mark A."},{"family":"McMahon","given":"Clive R."},{"family":"Bester","given":"Marthán N."},{"family":"Boehme","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Costa","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Fedak","given":"Mike A."},{"family":"Guinet","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Herraiz-Borreguero","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Harcourt","given":"Robert G."},{"family":"Huckstadt","given":"Luis"},{"family":"Kovacs","given":"Kit M."},{"family":"Lydersen","given":"Christian"},{"family":"McIntyre","given":"Trevor"},{"family":"Muelbert","given":"Monica"},{"family":"Patterson","given":"Toby"},{"family":"Roquet","given":"Fabien"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Guy"},{"family":"Charrassin","given":"Jean-Benoit"}],"citation-key":"hindell_etal16","container-title":"Ecosphere","DOI":"10.1002/ecs2.1213","ISSN":"2150-8925","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"e01213","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Circumpolar habitat use in the southern elephant seal: implications for foraging success and population trajectories","title-short":"Circumpolar habitat use in the southern elephant seal","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecs2.1213","volume":"7"},

Most individuals specialized on one of two feeding strategies distinguishable by behaviour visible at the surface: lunge feeding and ‘bird-association’ feeding. These strategies were consistent over a period of up to 5 years. Each feeding strategy was largely associated with a particular feeding area. The respiration intervals preceding and following a feeding event were significantly shorter during lunge feeding and pre-feeding dives were significantly longer for lunge feeders. Feeding rates appeared to be lower for bird-association feeders. It is suggested that individual specializations represent learned strategies that may have equivalent payoffs, and that they are adapted to variations in the distribution of the same prey species. This in turn is thought to be influenced by physical differences in the local marine habitat.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoelzel","given":"A.

Understanding the characteristic LHT of species is a crucial step in making sound conservation policies.

In this study, we collected and analyzed six LHT from published literature, including female asymptotic length (Lx), length at birth (Lb), length at sexual maturity (Lm), calving interval (CI), age at sexual maturity (Am) and lifespan (Ax) in order to explore their potential correlations with LHT which determine their maternal fi tness.

  {"id":"hucke-gaete_etal18","abstract":"Background The most traditional scheme for migration among baleen whales comprises yearly migrations between productive waters at high latitude summer feeding grounds and warmer waters at lower latitudes where whales calve and mate, but rarely feed. Evidence indicates, however, that large departures from this scheme exist among populations and individuals. Furthermore, for some populations there is virtually no information on migratory pathways and destinations. Such is the case of Chilean blue whales throughout the Eastern South Pacific; hence, the goal of this study was to assess its migratory behavior. Methods Dedicated marine surveys and satellite tagging efforts were undertaken during the austral summer and early autumn on blue whale feeding grounds off Chilean Northern Patagonia (CNP) during 2013, 2015 and 2016. Positional data derived from satellite tags regarding movement patterns and behavior were analyzed using Bayesian switching first-difference correlated random walk models. Results We instrumented 10 CNP blue whales with satellite transmitters and documented individual variation in departure time, northbound migratory routes and potential wintering grounds. The onset of migration occurred from mid/late austral autumn to well into the austral winter. Blue whales moved in various directions, but ultimately converged toward a general NW movement direction along a wide corridor exceeding 2,000 km. Area-Restricted Search behavior was exhibited within fjords and channels of CNP and also South of Galapagos Archipelago (GA) and northern Peru, but never during migration. Interestingly, dive profiles for one whale that reached GA showed a sharp and consistent increase in depth north of 5°S and extreme deep dives of up to 330 m. Discussion Information derived from satellite tagged blue whales in this study is the first of its kind off the Eastern Southern Pacific. Our results provide valuable information on their migratory timing, routes and behavior on their northbound migration, particularly regarding the varied migratory plasticity for this particular population. Our results also highlight the first record of two complete migratory paths between CNP and GA and strengthen the hypothesis that GA waters correspond to a potential wintering destination for CNP blue whales. We further hypothesize that this area might be selected because of its biological productivity, which could provide feeding opportunities during the breeding season. Our results suggest that special efforts should be put forward to identify blue whale critical areas and understand key behavioral aspects in order to provide the basis for their conservation on a regional context (i.e., reducing potential ship strike and promote Marine Protected Area (MPA) implementation in Chile, Ecuador and Peru). Indeed, we suggest joint blue whale conservation efforts at the regional level in order to identify and determine potential threats and impacts and, most importantly, implement prospective management actions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Hucke-Gaete","given":"Rodrigo"},{"family":"Bedriñana-Romano","given":"Luis"},{"family":"Viddi","given":"Francisco A."},{"family":"Ruiz","given":"Jorge E."},{"family":"Torres-Florez","given":"Juan Pablo"},{"family":"Zerbini","given":"Alexandre N."}],"citation-key":"hucke-gaete_etal18","container-title":"PeerJ","container-title-short":"PeerJ","DOI":"10.7717/peerj.4695","ISSN":"2167-8359","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","page":"e4695","publisher":"PeerJ Inc.","source":"peerj.com","title":"From Chilean Patagonia to Galapagos, Ecuador: novel insights on blue whale migratory pathways along the Eastern South Pacific","title-short":"From Chilean Patagonia to Galapagos, Ecuador","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://peerj.com/articles/4695","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"indeck_etal22","abstract":"Acoustic communication is important for animals with dependent young, particularly when they are spatially separated. Maternal humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) use acoustic calling to help minimize the risk of separation from their young calves during migration. These pairs also use acoustic crypsis to minimize detection by males. How they balance a restricted active space with the need to maintain acoustic contact during periods of separation is not yet understood. Here, we analyzed movement metrics of tagged adult female–calf pairs during migration to identify two behavioral states, “resting/milling” and “travelling.” When travelling, these pairs dived synchronously and exhibited little to no spatial separation. Alternatively, adult females had significantly longer dive durations (p < .01) when resting, and while they spent prolonged times at depth, calves would surface several times independently. This demonstrated that these pairs are frequently separated during periods of rest. We then determined whether the call rates and acoustic levels of these pairs increased with more frequent separation, finding that both adult females and calves significantly increased their call rates, but not levels, when resting. We also found that adult female–calf pairs have a restricted active space, with less than 15% of calls estimated to be detectable beyond 2 km. However, as with call level, detection distance did not differ significantly between the two behavioral states. In summary, adult female–calf pairs maintain successful communication during periods of separation by calling more frequently rather than by producing louder calls. This strategy aids in maintaining acoustic contact while simultaneously limiting detectability by conspecifics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Indeck","given":"Katherine L."},{"family":"Noad","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Dunlop","given":"Rebecca A."}],"citation-key":"indeck_etal22","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.8604","ISSN":"2045-7758","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"language":"en","page":"e8604","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Humpback whale adult females and calves balance acoustic contact with vocal crypsis during periods of increased separation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.8604","volume":"12"},

Argos-monitored satellite tags were attached to 171 blue whales off California during summer/early fall from 1993 to 2008. We analyzed portions of the tracks that occurred within U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone waters and defined the ‘home range’ (HR) and ‘core areas’ (CAU) as the 90% and 50% fixed kernel density distributions, respectively, for each whale. We used the number of overlapping individual HRs and CAUs to identify areas of highest use. Individual HR and CAU sizes varied dramatically, but without significant inter-annual variation despite covering years with El Niño and La Niña conditions. Observed within-year differences in HR size may represent different foraging strategies for individuals. The main areas of HR and CAU overlap among whales were near highly productive, strong upwelling centers that were crossed by commercial shipping lanes. Tagged whales generally departed U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone waters from mid-October to mid-November, with high variability among individuals. One 504-d track allowed HR and CAU comparisons for the same individual across two years, showing similar seasonal timing, and strong site fidelity. Our analysis showed how satellite-tagged blue whales seasonally used waters off the U.S. West Coast, including high-risk areas. We suggest possible modifications to existing shipping lanes to reduce the likelihood of collisions with vessels.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Irvine","given":"Ladd M."},{"family":"Mate","given":"Bruce R."},{"family":"Winsor","given":"Martha H."},{"family":"Palacios","given":"Daniel M."},{"family":"Bograd","given":"Steven J."},{"family":"Costa","given":"Daniel P."},{"family":"Bailey","given":"Helen"}],"citation-key":"irvine_etal14","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102959","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","page":"e102959","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Spatial and Temporal Occurrence of Blue Whales off the U.S. West Coast, with Implications for Management","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0102959","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"irvine_etal17","abstract":"Cetacean energy stores are known to vary according to life history, reproductive status and time of year; however, the opportunity to quantify these relationships is rare. Using a unique set of historical whaling records from Western Australia (1952–1963), we investigated energy stores of large cetaceans with differing life histories, and quantified the relationship between total body lipid and length for humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) (n = 905) and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) (n = 1961). We found that total body lipid increased with body length in both humpback and sperm whales, consistent with size-related energy stores. Male humpback whales stored 2.49 kl (15.6 barrels) (31.9–74.9%) more lipid than male sperm whales of equivalent length, to fuel their annual migration. Relative lipid stores of sperm whales (males) were constant throughout the year, while those of humpback whales varied with reproductive class and sampling date. Pregnant female humpback whales had higher relative energy stores than non-pregnant females and males (26.2% and 37.4%, respectively), to fuel the energy demands of gestation and lactation. Those that reached the sampling site later (en route to their breeding grounds) carried higher lipid stores than those that arrived earlier, possibly reflecting individual variation in residency times in the Antarctic feeding grounds. Importantly, longer pregnant females had relatively larger energy stores than the shorter pregnant females, indicating that the smaller individuals may experience higher levels of energetic stress during the migration fast. The relationships we developed between body lipid and length can be used to inform bioenergetics and ecosystem models when such detailed information is not available.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Irvine","given":"Lyn G."},{"family":"Thums","given":"Michele"},{"family":"Hanson","given":"Christine E."},{"family":"McMahon","given":"Clive R."},{"family":"Hindell","given":"Mark A."}],"citation-key":"irvine_etal17","container-title":"Royal Society Open Science","DOI":"10.1098/rsos.160290","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"page":"160290","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Quantifying the energy stores of capital breeding humpback whales and income breeding sperm whales using historical whaling records","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.160290","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"irvine_etal19","abstract":"Intermediate-duration archival tags were attached to eight blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus; four females, three males, one of unknown sex), and five fin whales (B. physalus; two females, one male, two of unknown sex) off southern California, USA, in summer 2014 and 2015. Tags logged 1-Hz data from tri-axial accelerometers, magnetometers, and a depth sensor, while acquiring Fastloc GPS locations. Tag attachment duration ranged from 18.3 to 28.9 d for blue whales and 4.9–16.0 d for fin whales, recording 1,030–4,603 dives and 95–3,338 GPS locations per whale across both species. Feeding lunges (identified from accelerometer data) were used to characterize “feeding bouts” (i.e., sequences of feeding dives with <60 min of consecutive non-feeding dives), within-bout behavior, and to examine the spatial distribution of feeding effort. Whales fed near the tagging locations (Point Mugu and San Miguel Island) for up to 7 d before dispersing as far south as Ensenada, Mexico, and north to Cape Mendocino, California. Dispersal within southern California waters differed by sex in both species with males undertaking offshore, circuitous excursions, while females remained more coastal, suggesting that movement patterns on the feeding grounds may not be exclusively related to energy gain. Feeding bout characteristics were similar for both species, with the median bout having 24 dives and lasting 3.3 h for blue whales (n = 242), and 19 dives while lasting 2.7 h for fin whales (n = 59). Bout duration was positively correlated with the number of feeding lunges per dive within a bout for both species, suggesting whales left poor-quality prey patches quickly but fed intensively for up to 34.9 h when prey was abundant. Feeding bouts occurred further apart as the distance from shore increased, but there was no corresponding difference in the number of feeding lunges per dive, suggesting the whales were feeding at the same rate throughout their range, but that prey was more dispersed in offshore waters. This may be evidence of two feeding strategies, with spatially aggregated foraging around highly localized, topographically forced upwelling centers nearshore, and more dispersed foraging in larger areas of elevated, but patchy, productivity offshore.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Irvine","given":"Ladd M."},{"family":"Palacios","given":"Daniel M."},{"family":"Lagerquist","given":"Barbara A."},{"family":"Mate","given":"Bruce R."}],"citation-key":"irvine_etal19","container-title":"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","ISSN":"2296-701X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Scales of Blue and Fin Whale Feeding Behavior off California, USA, With Implications for Prey Patchiness","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fevo.2019.00338","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"irvine_etal20","abstract":"Argos satellite telemetry is used globally to track terrestrial and aquatic megafauna, yet the accuracy of this system has been described empirically only for a limited number of species. We used Argos-linked archival tags with Fastloc GPS deployed on free-ranging sperm (Physeter macrocephalus), blue (Balaenoptera musculus), and fin (B. physalus) whales to derive empirical estimates of Argos location errors for these species, examine possible behavior-related differences, and test the effect of incorporating species-specific error parameters on performance of a commonly used movement model. Argos location errors for blue and fin whale tags were similar and were combined (n=1712 locations) for comparison against sperm whale tags (n=1206 locations). Location error magnitudes for tags attached to sperm whales were significantly larger than blue/fin whale tags for almost all Argos location classes (LC), ranging from 964m versus 647m for LC 3, respectively, to 10,569m versus 5589m for LC B, respectively. However, these differences were not seen while tags floated at the surface after release. Sperm whale tags were significantly colder than ambient temperature when surfacing from a dive, compared to blue/fin whale tags (16.9°C versus 1.3°C, respectively) leading to larger changes in tag temperature during post-dive intervals. The increased rate of tag temperature change while at the surface was correlated to increased error magnitude for sperm whales but not blue/fin whales. Movement model performance was not significantly improved by incorporating species-specific error parameters. Location accuracy estimates for blue/fin whales were within the range estimated for other marine megafauna, but were higher for sperm whales. Thermal inertia from deep, long-duration dives likely caused transmission frequency drift and greater Argos location error in sperm whales, as tags warmed at the surface during post-dive intervals. Thus, tracks of deep-diving species may be less accurate than for other species. However, differences in calculated error magnitude between species were less than typical scales of movement and had limited effect on movement model performance. Therefore, broad-scale interpretation of Argos tracking data will likely be unaffected, although fine-scale interpretation should be made with more caution for deep-diving species inhabiting warm regions.","author":[{"family":"Irvine","given":"Ladd M."},{"family":"Winsor","given":"Martha H."},{"family":"Follett","given":"Tomas M."},{"family":"Mate","given":"Bruce R."},{"family":"Palacios","given":"Daniel M."}],"citation-key":"irvine_etal20","container-title":"Animal Biotelemetry","DOI":"10.1186/s40317-020-00207-x","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 3033454443","page":"1-17","title":"An at-sea assessment of Argos location accuracy for three species of large whales, and the effect of deep-diving behavior on location error","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"ishikawa_etal21","abstract":"The Antarctic minke whale (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) is a seasonal migrator that feeds mainly on Antarctic krill at higher latitudes during the summer and travels to lower latitudes to breed in winter. A previous study using δ13C and δ15N values of baleen plates showed that pregnant Antarctic minke whales feed on Antarctic krill in the foraging season, with less feeding during the breeding season. However, long-term changes in the habitat use and diet of males remain unknown. In this study, we estimated the foraging habits of nine mature male Antarctic minke whales using the stable isotope signatures of baleen plates. From Bayesian stable isotope mixing models, it was found that Antarctic krill was the predominant prey of male whales, and prey species in lower latitudes were rarely incorporated into the baleen plates. This result is consistent with that of female Antarctic minke whales. Eight whales showed at least one oscillation in δ13C and δ15N values, whereas one whale (AM246) showed no variation in δ15N values. This possibly indicates that AM246 remained in the Antarctic water year-round.

In the video logger footage, two non-tagged resting individuals, which did not spread their flippers or move their flukes, were observed above a tagged animal, representing an apparent bout of group resting. During the video logger recording, the swim speed was relatively slow (0.75m s−1), and the tagged animal made only a few strokes of very low amplitude during drift diving. We report the drift dives as resting behaviour specific to baleen whales as same as seals, sperm whales and loggerhead turtles.

  {"id":"izadi_etal18","abstract":"Many animals require intervals of rest or sleep in which their vigilance level is reduced. For marine fauna, including large baleen whales, resting potentially increases the risk of predation and vessel-strike. However, there is scarce information about how, and how often, whales rest which makes it difficult to assess the severity of this risk. Here we examine resting patterns of Bryde’s whales (Baleaenoptera edeni/brydei), using data collected by sound and movement archival tags (DTAGs) deployed on four whales in the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand. To identify low activity levels associated with resting, we used RMS jerk and mean flow noise (as proxies for activity and speed, respectively), as well as changes in dive patterns (dive depth and shape), fluking, and respiration rates. The tagged whales showed strong diel differences in behavior with long periods of low activity consistent with resting occurring exclusively during the night. This pattern indicates that either (i) Bryde’s whales rely on senses that are less effective in the dark to locate prey, or (ii) that prey aggregate less densely at night, making foraging less efficient. Thus, Bryde’s whales conserve energy through rest during times when the net benefit of foraging effort is low. However, by reducing their interaction level with their environment, night-time resting also makes Bryde’s whales more vulnerable to vessel strikes, an important source of mortality for cetaceans.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Izadi","given":"Sahar"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Soto","given":"Natacha Aguilar","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Constantine","given":"Rochelle"}],"citation-key":"izadi_etal18","container-title":"Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology","DOI":"10.1007/s00265-018-2492-8","ISSN":"0340-5443, 1432-0762","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","source":"Crossref","title":"Night-life of Bryde’s whales: ecological implications of resting in a baleen whale","title-short":"Night-life of Bryde’s whales","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00265-018-2492-8","volume":"72"},

Overall recapture rates also more than doubled when predators were excluded compared to natural conditions (72.4 vs. 34.9%).

  {"id":"jensen_etal20","abstract":"Toothed whales have evolved flexible biosonar systems to find, track and capture prey in diverse habitats. Delphinids and phocoenids adjust inter-click intervals and source levels gradually while approaching prey. In contrast, deep-diving beaked and sperm whales maintain relatively constant inter-click intervals and apparent output levels during the approach followed by a rapid transition into the foraging buzz, presumably to maintain a long-range acoustic scene in a multi-target environment. However, it remains unknown whether this rapid biosonar adjustment strategy is shared by delphinids foraging in deep waters. To test this, we investigated biosonar adjustments of a deep-diving delphinid, the Risso9s dolphin (Grampus griseus). We analyzed inter-click interval and apparent output level adjustments recorded from sound recording tags to quantify in-situ sensory adjustment during prey capture attempts. Risso9s dolphins did not follow typical 20-log(range) biosonar adjustment patterns seen in shallow-water species, but instead maintained stable repetition rates and output levels up to the foraging buzz. Our results suggest that maintaining a long-range acoustic scene to exploit complex, multi-target prey layers is a common strategy amongst deep-diving toothed whales. Risso9s dolphins transitioned rapidly into the foraging buzz just like beaked whales during most foraging attempts, but employed a more gradual biosonar adjustment in a subset (19%) of prey approaches. These were characterized by higher speeds and minimum specific acceleration, indicating higher prey capture efforts associated with evasive prey. Thus, tracking and capturing evasive prey using biosonar may require a more gradual switch between multi-target echolocation and single-target tracking.","author":[{"family":"Jensen","given":"Frants H."},{"family":"Keller","given":"Onno A."},{"family":"Tyack","given":"Peter L."},{"family":"Visser","given":"Fleur"}],"citation-key":"jensen_etal20","container-title":"The Journal of Experimental Biology","DOI":"10.1242/jeb.216283","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2995016594","PMID":"31822550","title":"Dynamic biosonar adjustment strategies in deep-diving Risso's dolphins driven partly by prey evasion","type":"article-journal","volume":"223"},

We made 13 successful deployments (defined as tag duration of 15 min and successful recovery of the tag and data) totaling 19 hours of CRITTERCAMs on blue whales off California and in the Sea of Cortez from spring through fall (26 February to 30 September) between 1999 and 2003 . Whale diving depth and behavior varied widely by region and period, although deployments on different individuals in the same area and period often showed very similar feeding behavior. One deployment extending into night showed a diurnal shift in diving behavior with progressively shallower feeding dives as it became dark, with shift to shallow, apparently non-feeding dives during the night. Data and video from tags demonstrated that the characteristic series of vertical movements blue whales make at depth are lunges into dense aggregations of krill. These krill were visible streaming by the camera immediately before these lunges and more clearly when the whales? forward motion stopped as a result of the lunge. The progression of events leading up to and during the lunge could be documented from the head movement of whales and occasional views of the expanding throat pleats or lower jaw, and by changes in flow noise past the tag, indicating a rapid deceleration. One set of deployments in the Southern California Bight revealed consistent feeding at depths of 250-300 m, deeper than has been previously reported for blue whales.

How these elusive toothed whales use and react to sound is of concern because they mass strand during naval sonar exercises. A new non-invasive acoustic ording tag was attached to four beaked whales(two Mesoplodon densirostris and two Ziphius cavirostris) and recorded high-frequency clicks during deep dives. The tagged whales only clicked at depths below 200 m, down to a maximum depth of 1267 m. Both species produced a large number of short, directional, ultrasonic clicks with significant energy below 20 kHz. The tags recorded echoes from prey items; to our knowledge, a first for any animal echolocating in the wild. As far as we are aware, these echoes provide the first direct evidence on how free-ranging toothed whales use echolocation in foraging. The strength of these echoes suggests that the source level of Mesoplodon clicks is in the range of 200-220 dB re 1 microPa at 1 m.This paper presents conclusive data on the normal vocalizations of these beaked whale species, which may enable acoustic monitoring to mitigate exposure to sounds intense enough to harm them.","author":[{"family":"Johnson","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Madsen","given":"Peter T."},{"family":"Zimmer","given":"Walter M.

  {"id":"johnson_etal09","abstract":"Many marine animals use sound passively or actively for communication, foraging, predator avoidance, navigation, and to sense their environment. The advent of acoustic recording tags has allowed biologists to get the on-animal perspective of the sonic environment and, in combi- nation with movement sensors, to relate sounds to the activities of the tagged animal. These power- ful tools have led to a wide range of insights into the behaviour of marine animals and have opened new opportunities for studying the ways they interact with their environment. Acoustic tags demand new analysis methods and careful experimental design to optimize the consistency between research objectives and the realistic performance of the tags. Technical details to consider are the suitability of the tag attachment to a given species, the accuracy of the tag sensors, and the recording and attach- ment duration of the tag. Here we consider the achievements, potential, and limitations of acoustic recording tags in studying the behaviour, habitat use and sensory ecology of marine mammals, the taxon to which this technology has been most often applied. We examine the application of acoustic tags to studies of vocal behaviour, foraging ecology, acoustic tracking, and the effects of noise to assess both the breadth of applications and the specific issues that arise in each.","author":[{"family":"Johnson","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Soto","given":"Natacha Aguilar","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Madsen","given":"Peter T."}],"citation-key":"johnson_etal09","container-title":"Marine Ecology Progress Series","DOI":"10.3354/meps08255","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,12,3]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2131558426","page":"55-73","title":"Studying the behaviour and sensory ecology of marine mammals using acoustic recording tags: a review","type":"article-journal","volume":"395"},
  {"id":"johnson_etal22","abstract":"A new collaborative report from WWF and science partners provides the first comprehensive look at whale migrations and the threats they face across all oceans, highlighting how the cumulative impacts from industrial fishing, ship strikes, pollution, habitat loss, and climate change are creating a hazardous journey. Protecting Blue Corridors report visualises the satellite tracks of over 1000 migratory whales worldwide. The report outlines how whales are encountering multiple and growing threats in their critical ocean habitats – areas where they feed, mate, give birth, and nurse their young – and along their migration superhighways, or ‘blue corridors’. The report is a collaborative analysis of 30 years of scientific data contributed by more than 50 research groups, with leading marine scientists from Oregon State University, the University of California Santa Cruz, the University of Southampton and others. Case studies highlight hotspots and risks that whales navigate on their migrations, some of which can be thousands of kilometers each year. As a result of these hazards, six out of the 13 great whale species are now classified as endangered or vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, even after decades of protection after commercial whaling. Among those populations most at risk is the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale, a species that migrates between Canada and the United States. It is at its lowest point in 20 years – numbering only 336 individuals.  Protecting Blue Corridors calls for a new conservation approach to address these mounting threats and safeguard whales, through enhanced cooperation from local to regional to international levels. Of particular urgency is engagement with the United Nations, which is set to finalise negotiations on a new treaty for the high seas (Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction) in March 2022. The benefits from protected blue corridors extend far beyond whales. Growing evidence shows the critical role whales play maintaining ocean health and our global climate – with one whale capturing the same amount of carbon as thousands of trees. The International Monetary Fund estimates the value of a single great whale at more than US$2 million, which totals more than US$1 trillion for the current global population of great whales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Johnson","given":"Christopher M."},{"family":"Reisinger","given":"Ryan R."},{"family":"Palacios","given":"Daniel M."},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari S."},{"family":"Zerbini","given":"Alexandre N."},{"family":"Willson","given":"Andy"},{"family":"Lancaster","given":"Melanie"},{"family":"Battle","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Graham","given":"Alistair"},{"family":"Cosandey-Godin","given":"Aurelie"},{"family":"Jacob","given":"Théa"},{"family":"Felix","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Grilly","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Shahid","given":"Umair"},{"family":"Houtman","given":"Nathalie"},{"family":"Alberini","given":"Amalia"},{"family":"Montecinos","given":"Yacqueline"},{"family":"Najera","given":"Eduardo"},{"family":"Kelez","given":"Shaleyla"}],"citation-key":"johnson_etal22","DOI":"10.5281/zenodo.6196131","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Zenodo","source":"Zenodo","title":"Protecting Blue Corridors - Challenges and solutions for migratory whales navigating national and international seas","type":"report","URL":"https://zenodo.org/record/6196131"},

A novel archival tag, called the DTAG, has been developed to monitor the behavior of marine mammals, and their response to sound, continuously throughout the dive cycle. The tag contains a large array of solid-state memory and records continuously from a built-in hydrophone and suite of sensors. The sensors sample the orientation of the animal in three dimensions with sufficient speed and resolution to capture individual fluke strokes. Audio and sensor recording is synchronous so the relative timing of sounds and motion can be determined precisely. The DTAG has been attached to more than 30 northern right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) and 20 sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) with recording duration of up to 12 h per deployment.

  {"id":"joly_etal19","abstract":"Long-distance terrestrial migrations are imperiled globally. We determined both round-trip migration distances (straight-line measurements between migratory end points) and total annual movement (sum of the distances between successive relocations over a year) for a suite of large mammals that had potential for long-distance movements to test which species displayed the longest of both. We found that caribou likely do exhibit the longest terrestrial migrations on the planet, but, over the course of a year, gray wolves move the most. Our results were consistent with the trophic-level based hypothesis that predators would move more than their prey. Herbivores in low productivity environments moved more than herbivores in more productive habitats. We also found that larger members of the same guild moved less than smaller members, supporting the ‘gastro-centric’ hypothesis. A better understanding of migration and movements of large mammals should aid in their conservation by helping delineate conservation area boundaries and determine priority corridors for protection to preserve connectivity. The magnitude of the migrations and movements we documented should also provide guidance on the scale of conservation efforts required and assist conservation planning across agency and even national boundaries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Joly","given":"Kyle"},{"family":"Gurarie","given":"Eliezer"},{"family":"Sorum","given":"Mathew S."},{"family":"Kaczensky","given":"Petra"},{"family":"Cameron","given":"Matthew D."},{"family":"Jakes","given":"Andrew F."},{"family":"Borg","given":"Bridget L."},{"family":"Nandintsetseg","given":"Dejid"},{"family":"Hopcraft","given":"J.

  {"id":"jonsson97","abstract":"In order to compensate for the resource demands of reproduction, organisms usually increase the amount of total food resources available. This may be achieved by different tactics of resource use that also include foraging decisions. Two such general tactics are discussed in this paper under the concepts of capital and income breeding. These are defined mainly from the temporal distribution of resource acquisition relative to resource use. A capital breeder acquires its resources in advance and store them endogenously or exogenously until they are needed to supply aspects of offspring production. An income breeder, on the other hand, adjusts its food intake concurrently with breeding, without reliance on stores. In a perfectly predictable environment without limited resources, income breeding is the best option since capital breeders may have to pay a number of energetic and demographic costs for their stored resources. However, under unpredictable food conditions, food/time limitations, and risky foraging conditions, capital breeding offers many benefits. The costing systems (pre- or postbreeding costs) induced by capital and income breeding will largely influence the opportunity for these energetic tactics to evolve. While capital and income breeders may potentially experience both pre- and postbreeding costs, capital breeders may be more exposed to prebreeding costs due to predation in connection with acquisition and carriage of stores.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Jönsson","given":"K.

Since the eighteenth century4, the Wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans) has been thought to be one of the most widely ranging seabirds, and breeders are thought to travel up to 1,800 km from the nest on foraging trips5,6. Here, we describe the first successful tracking of a bird using satellite telemetry. Tracks of Wandering albatrosses in the southwestern Indian Ocean showed that they covered between 3,600 and 15,000 km in a single foraging trip during an incubation shift. They flew at speeds of up to 80 km per h and over distances of up to 900 km per day. They remained active at night, particularly on moonlit nights and wind appeared to have a major influence on the foraging strategy of these albatrosses. Detailed knowledge of their movements at sea may prove critical to the conservation of the Wandering albatross and particularly of the closely related Amsterdam albatross (D. amsterdamensis), both of which are endangered7–9.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Jouventin","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Weimerskirch","given":"Henri"}],"citation-key":"jouventin_weimerskirch90","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/343746a0","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"6260","issued":{"date-parts":[[1990,2]]},"language":"en","license":"1990 Springer Nature Limited","number":"6260","page":"746-748","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Satellite tracking of Wandering albatrosses","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/343746a0","volume":"343"},

  {"id":"kahane-rapport_etal20","abstract":"Fundamental scaling relationships influence the physiology of vital rates, which in turn shape the ecology and evolution of organisms. For diving mammals, benefits conferred by large body size include reduced transport costs and enhanced breath-holding capacity, thereby increasing overall foraging efficiency. Rorqual whales feed by engulfing a large mass of prey-laden water at high speed and filtering it through baleen plates. However, as engulfment capacity increases with body length (engulfment volume∝body length3.57), the surface area of the baleen filter does not increase proportionally (baleen area∝body length1.82), and thus the filtration time of larger rorquals predictably increases as the baleen surface area must filter a disproportionally large amount of water. We predicted that filtration time should scale with body length to the power of 1.75 (filter time∝body length1.75). We tested this hypothesis on four rorqual species using multi-sensor tags with corresponding unoccupied aircraft systems-based body length estimates. We found that filter time scales with body length to the power of 1.79 (95% CI: 1.61–1.97). This result highlights a scale-dependent trade-off between engulfment capacity and baleen area that creates a biomechanical constraint to foraging through increased filtration time. Consequently, larger whales must target high-density prey patches commensurate to the gulp size to meet their increased energetic demands. If these optimal patches are absent, larger rorquals may experience reduced foraging efficiency compared with smaller whales if they do not match their engulfment capacity to the size of targeted prey aggregations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Kahane-Rapport","given":"S.

Here, we combine depth-integrated microplastic data from the California Current Ecosystem with high-resolution foraging measurements from 191 tag deployments on blue, fin, and humpback whales to quantify plastic ingestion rates and routes of exposure. We find that baleen whales predominantly feed at depths of 50–250 m, coinciding with the highest measured microplastic concentrations in the pelagic ecosystem. Nearly all (99%) microplastic ingestion is predicted to occur via trophic transfer. We predict that fish-feeding whales are less exposed to microplastic ingestion than krill-feeding whales. Per day, a krill-obligate blue whale may ingest 10 million pieces of microplastic, while a fish-feeding humpback whale likely ingests 200,000 pieces of microplastic.

  {"id":"kahane-rapport_goldbogen18","abstract":"Body length is one of the most important factors that influence organismal function and ecological niche. Although larger animals tend to have a suite of physiological advantages, such as lower mass-specific metabolic rates and lower costs of transport, they may also experience significant limitations to unsteady locomotor performance or maneuverability because of the relative scaling of control surface areas and body mass. Rorqual whales are the largest of all animals and thus represent a unique study system for understanding how animals function at the extreme of body mass. Rorquals are characterized by an engulfment-filtration foraging strategy facilitated by a complex set of morphological adaptations. We studied the scaling of key morphological structures related to locomotion and feeding in six rorqual species in a comparative framework. Our analyses show that most rorqual species exhibit positive allometry of both the control surfaces and body length, but the large scaling differences between these parameters suggest that larger rorquals will predictably suffer from decreased maneuverability and unsteady locomotor performance. However, we found that the dimensions of the engulfment apparatus also exhibit positive allometry, and thus engulfment capacity was relatively greater in larger rorquals. We posit that the allometric growth in the engulfment apparatus may be an adaptation that ameliorates the detrimental effects of large size on maneuverability. Our analyses also reveal significant differences in the scaling of mass-specific engulfment capacity among rorqual species that may reflect the evolution of unique foraging behaviors and the exploitation of divergent ecological niches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Kahane‐Rapport","given":"Shirel R."},{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Jeremy A."}],"citation-key":"kahane-rapport_goldbogen18","container-title":"Journal of Morphology","DOI":"10.1002/jmor.20846","ISSN":"1097-4687","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","page":"1256-1268","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Allometric scaling of morphology and engulfment capacity in rorqual whales","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmor.20846","volume":"279"},

  {"id":"kc_bierlich_etal22","abstract":"Most baleen whales are capital breeders that use stored energy acquired on foraging grounds to finance the costs of migration and reproduction on breeding grounds. Body condition reflects past foraging success and can act as a proxy for individual fitness. Hence, monitoring the seasonal gain in body condition of baleen whales while on the foraging grounds can inform how marine mammals support the costs of migration, growth, and reproduction, as well as the nutritional health of the overall population. Here, we use photogrammetry from drone-based imagery to examine how the body condition of humpback whales ( Megaptera novaeangliae ) changed over the foraging season (November to June) along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) from 2017 to 2019. This population (IWC stock G) is recovering from past whaling and is growing rapidly, providing an opportunity to study how whales store energy in a prey-rich environment. We used a body area index (BAI) to estimate changes in body condition and applied a Bayesian approach to incorporate measurement uncertainty associated with different drone types used for data collection. We used biopsy samples to determine sex and pregnancy status, and a length-based maturity classification to assign reproductive classes ( n = 228; calves = 31, juveniles = 82, lactating females = 31, mature males = 12, mature unknown sex = 56, non-pregnant females = 12, pregnant females = 3, pregnant &amp;amp; lactating females = 1). Average BAI increased linearly over the feeding season for each reproductive class. Lactating females had lower BAI compared to other mature whales late in the season, reflecting the high energetic costs of nursing a calf. Mature males and non-pregnant females had the highest BAI values. Calves and juvenile whales exhibited an increase in BAI but not structural size (body length) over the feeding season. The body length of lactating mothers was positively correlated with the body length of their calves, but no relationship was observed between the BAI of mothers and their calves. Our study establishes a baseline for seasonal changes in the body condition for this humpback whale population, which can help monitor future impacts of disturbance and climate change.","author":[{"literal":"KC.

  {"id":"kenney_etal01","abstract":"Western North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) utilise several important foraging habitats off the northeastern United States and eastern Canada, where they feed on dense patches of zooplankton. At a fundamental level, a right whale’s optimal strategy should be to locate and exploit the prey patches with the highest net energetic return from foraging. There remain many questions, however, concerning their migration and foraging strategies and the environmental cues and sensory modalities involved in migration and foraging, all of which are likely to vary at different spatial scales. For example, a right whale most likely uses different mechanisms and strategies for location of primary feeding grounds than those used for detection of optimum prey patches within a feeding area. This paper proposes a multi-scaled, hierarchical, conceptual model of right whale migratory and foraging strategies and presents a variety of hypotheses concerning the mechanisms involved. Right whales may return to the general area of their feeding grounds based on prior experience. The locations of successful foraging in the immediately preceding years are likely to be re-visited, as are habitats to which an animal was exposed while accompanying its mother during its first year of life. It is also possible that the whales utilise large- or medium-scale environmental cues, such as currents, temperature discontinuities, or salinity signals indicating coastal plumes, to locate likely areas of high zooplankton patch density. Whilst on their feeding grounds, right whales tend to be aggregated, but there are usually outliers which may represent occasional excursions in search of other prey patches, though there is currently no evidence to address whether they communicate information about prey to other individuals. Their behaviour whilst actively feeding indicates that they can detect differences in patch density and adjust their behaviour accordingly. A likely sensory mechanism for quantification of patch density and triggering of feeding behaviour would be the vibrissae around the anterior opening of the mouth.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Kenney","given":"Robert D."},{"family":"Mayo","given":"Charles A."},{"family":"Winn","given":"Howard E."}],"citation-key":"kenney_etal01","container-title":"J.

  {"id":"kettemer_etal22","abstract":"In the northern hemisphere, humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) typically migrate between summer/autumn feeding grounds at high latitudes, and specific winter/spring breeding grounds at low latitudes. Northeast Atlantic (NEA) humpback whales for instance forage in the Barents Sea and breed either in the West Indies, or the Cape Verde Islands, undertaking the longest recorded mammalian migration (~ 9 000 km). However, in the past decade hundreds of individuals have been observed foraging on herring during the winter in fjord systems along the northern Norwegian coast, with unknown consequences to their migration phenology, breeding behavior and energy budgets. Here we present the first complete migration track (321 days, January 8th, 2019—December 6th, 2019) of a humpback whale, a pregnant female that was equipped with a satellite tag in northern Norway. We show that whales can use foraging grounds in the NEA (Barents Sea, coastal Norway, and Iceland) sequentially within the same migration cycle, foraging in the Barents Sea in summer/fall and in coastal Norway and Iceland in winter. The migration speed was fast (1.6 ms-1), likely to account for the long migration distance (18 300 km) and long foraging season, but varied throughout the migration, presumably in response to the calf’s needs after its birth. The energetic cost of this migration was higher than for individuals belonging to other populations. Our results indicate that large whales can modulate their migration speed to balance foraging opportunities with migration phenology, even for the longest migrations and under the added constraint of reproduction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Kettemer","given":"Lisa Elena"},{"family":"Rikardsen","given":"Audun H."},{"family":"Biuw","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Broms","given":"Fredrik"},{"family":"Mul","given":"Evert"},{"family":"Blanchet","given":"Marie-Anne"}],"citation-key":"kettemer_etal22","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0268355","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"language":"en","page":"e0268355","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Round-trip migration and energy budget of a breeding female humpback whale in the Northeast Atlantic","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0268355","volume":"17"},

These values agree well with those reported for bacteria. A theoretical relationship was developed which allowed the biosynthetic and maintenance energy requirements to be estimated. The biosynthesis of LS cells required i-6 x io\"11 moles of ATP/cell. The maintenance energy, which is a function of growth rate, was 2-9 x io\"\"11 moles ATP/new cell when the mean generation time was 1-15 days. The proportion of the total energy used for maintenance under these conditions was 65 %. This corresponds to a value of less than 1 0 % for bacterial maintenance when the organisms are grown at near their maximum rate. A comparison of biosynthetic energy requirements indicates that bacteria and moulds require about 4 times as much energy as animal cells to generate the same weight of cell material. Possible explanations of this difference are discussed.","author":[{"family":"Kilburn","given":"D G"},{"family":"Lilly","given":"M D"},{"family":"Webb","given":"F C"}],"citation-key":"kilburn_etal69","issued":{"date-parts":[[1969]]},"language":"en","page":"10","source":"Zotero","title":"The energetics of mammalian cell growth","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"kojeszewski_fish07","abstract":"Summary The submerged swimming of the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris), a subspecies of the West Indian manatee, was studied by filming individuals as they swam rectilinearly in a large pool at several rehabilitation centers. The swimming was analyzed using videography to detail the kinematics in conjunction with a hydromechanical model to determine the power output (Pt) and propulsive efficiency (␩p). Manatees swam at velocities of 0.06–1.14·m·s–1. Locomotion was accomplished by undulation of the body and caudal fluke. Undulatory locomotion is a rapid and relatively high-powered propulsive mode involved in cruising and migrating by a variety of swimmers. Manatees displayed an undulatory swimming mode by passing a dorso-ventrally oriented traveling wave posteriorly along the body. The propulsive wave traveled at a higher velocity than the forward velocity of the animal. The frequency of the propulsive cycle (f) increased linearly with increasing swimming velocity (U). Amplitude at the tip of the caudal fluke (A) remained constant with respect to U and was 22% of body length. Pt increased curvilinearly with U. The mean ␩p, expressing the relationship of the thrust power generated by the paddle-shaped caudal fluke to the total mechanical power, was 0.73. The maximum ␩p was 0.82 at 0.95·m·s–1. Despite use of a primitive undulatory swimming mode and paddlelike fluke for propulsion, the manatee is capable of swimming with a high efficiency but lower power outputs compared with the oscillatory movements of the highaspect ratio flukes of cetaceans. The swimming performance of the manatee is in accordance with its habits as an aquatic grazer that seasonally migrates over extended distances.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Kojeszewski","given":"T."},{"family":"Fish","given":"F.

  {"id":"kok_etal23","abstract":"Rorqual foraging behavior varies with species, prey type and foraging conditions, and can be a determining factor for their fitness. Little is known about the foraging ecology of Rice’s whales (Balaenoptera ricei), an endangered species with a population of fewer than 100 individuals. Suction cup tags were attached to two Rice’s whales to collect information on their diving kinematics and foraging behavior. The tagged whales primarily exhibited lunge-feeding near the sea bottom and to a lesser extent in the water-column and at the sea surface. During 6–10 min foraging dives, the whales typically circled their prey before executing one or two feeding lunges. Longer duration dives and dives with more feeding-lunges were followed by an increase in their breathing rate. The median lunge rate of one lunge per dive of both animals was much lower than expected based on comparative research on other lunge-feeding baleen whales, and may be associated with foraging on fish instead of krill or may be an indication of different foraging conditions. Both animals spent extended periods of the night near the sea surface, increasing the risk for ship strike. Furthermore, their circling before lunging may increase the risk for entanglement in bottom-longline fishing gear. Overall, these data show that Rice’s whale foraging behavior differs from other lunge feeding rorqual species and may be a significant factor in shaping our understanding of their foraging ecology. Efforts to mitigate threats to Rice’s whales will benefit from improved understanding of patterns in their habitat use and fine-scale ecology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Kok","given":"Annebelle C.

  {"id":"kooyman04","abstract":"Bio-logging devices have become an integral part of many studies on the behav- ior, physiology and ecology of marine vertebrates. In the beginning, 1963, a time depth recorder (TDR) was designed to measure time and depth of freely diving Weddell seals, Leptonychotes weddellii, in the Antarctic. This was the first device used to obtain detailed information on underwater activity of an aquatic animal. It recorded data for one hour. Since that time there has been a steady evolution of this type of recorder. In 1975 a revised TDR with an extended time base of 14 days recorded the diving activity of the northern fur seal, Callorhinus ursinus. Through the rest of the 1970's and 1980's other fur seal species, as well as Weddell seals, and leather back sea turtles were studied, and the inventive pace of the TDR quickened. In 1981 an elegant mechanical recorder that lasted for three months was deployed. The emergence of microprocessors in the 1980's made possible further miniatur- ization and the logging of several additional variables. The next revolution occurred in the 1990's with the inception of satellite transmitters that made it possible to determine precise- ly where an animal was on the planet, and to retrieve other data as well. This remarkable abil- ity to incorporate the measurement of spatial distribution was soon augmented by a third rev- olution, the use of mountable videocameras or camcorders on the animals themselves. With this arsenal of bio-logging devices many questions about aquatic animals are being resolved that were only dreams for the first generation of biologists studying the marine activities of vertebrates.","author":[{"family":"Kooyman","given":"Gerald"}],"citation-key":"kooyman04","container-title":"Memoirs of the National Institute of Polar Research","container-title-short":"Memoirs of the National Institute of Polar Research","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"Genesis and evolution of bio-logging devices: 1963-2002","title-short":"Genesis and evolution of bio-logging devices","type":"article-journal","volume":"58"},

Most rorquals capture prey using a behavioral process known as lunge-feeding that, when occurring at the surface, often exposes the mouth and head above the water. New technology has recently improved historical misconceptions about the natural variation in rorqual lunge-feeding behavior yet missing from the literature is a dedicated study of the identification, use, and evolution of these behaviors when used to capture prey at the surface.

We then tested for differences in frequency of these behaviors among the three species and across all rorqual species. Our results: (1) propose a unified classification system of six homologous SLF behaviors used by all living rorqual whale species; (2) demonstrate statistically significant differences in the frequency of each behavior by minke, fin, and blue whales; and (3) provide new information regarding the evolution of lunge-feeding behaviors among rorqual whales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Kot","given":"Brian W."},{"family":"Sears","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Zbinden","given":"Dany"},{"family":"Borda","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Gordon","given":"Malcolm S."}],"citation-key":"kot_etal14","container-title":"Marine Mammal Science","DOI":"10.1111/mms.12115","ISSN":"1748-7692","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","page":"1335-1357","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Rorqual whale (Balaenopteridae) surface lunge-feeding behaviors: Standardized classification, repertoire diversity, and evolutionary analyses","title-short":"Rorqual whale (Balaenopteridae) surface lunge-feeding behaviors","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mms.12115","volume":"30"},

If the compression fails to interfere with the circulation, I do not think that the diffusion of nitrogen or oxygen will be very seriously impaired. M.

Tracking ranged from 222 to 10,481 km over 4.9–149.1 d. Eight whales left Socorro Island: five visited other Mexican wintering destinations, seven moved north of these areas.

Here we identify a major structural component of a stay apparatus that exists in the rorqual craniomandibular system. This fibrous appendage of the temporalis muscle introduces a continuous, mechanical linkage between the supraorbital process of the frontal bone and the coronoid process of the mandible. It is named the frontomandibular stay. Anatomic relationships and biomechanical findings predict that this structure would control and assist a process of continuous change in position of the jaws during engulfment events. The dynamic form of mandibular kinesis produced would function to increase the power of feeding. Owing to the stay's nonmuscular construction, its mechanical action necessarily is driven by the kinetic mass of the moving whale.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Lambertsen","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Ulrich","given":"Nathan"},{"family":"Straley","given":"Janice"}],"citation-key":"lambertsen_etal95","container-title":"Journal of Mammalogy","container-title-short":"Journal of Mammalogy","DOI":"10.2307/1382758","ISSN":"0022-2372","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1995]]},"page":"877-899","source":"Silverchair","title":"Frontomandibular Stay of Balaenopteridae: A Mechanism for Momentum Recapture during Feeding","title-short":"Frontomandibular Stay of Balaenopteridae","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.2307/1382758","volume":"76"},
  {"id":"lambertsen_hintz04","abstract":"Cranial anatomy of baleen whales was examined in order to identify evolutionary morphological novelties. Complex surfaces of the mandibles and craniums of 4 minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) were plotted in 3 dimensions by close-range photogrammetry. Photogrammetric data sets representing naturally opposed borders of the mandible and maxilla were used to determine 3-dimensional (3D) conformal coordinate transformations. These allowed the creation of precise 3D computer models of the skulls in which the strongly bowed mandibles were closely opposed along their entire length to the curved lateral borders of the rostrum. This simulated mouth closure. Subsequent internal measurements demonstrated a biomechanical specialization heretofore unknown in the class Mammalia—a maxillomandibular cam articulation. This novel articulation would operate as an adjunct to the temporomandibular joint in the final stage of mouth closure. Our functional interpretation is that it is at least a mechanism by which the energy cost of carrying a gigantic, expandable mouth at speed through an aqueous medium could be kept to a minimum. This articulation also may be part of a critically important trigger mechanism needed for precisely timed deployment of the feeding apparatus while it is under high hydrodynamic loads.

  {"id":"lambertsen83","abstract":"[This study elucidated the internal mechanism that enables rorquals (Balaenopteridae) to engulf a large volume of water prior to filtering it for prey. Anatomic experiments and observations were made on specimens of Balaenoptera acutorostrata, B. borealis, and B. physalus to assess the dynamic relationships of the tongue, nonlingual intermandibular lining, and cavum ventrale (a tissue cleft beneath the grooved, ventral body wall) as they would occur during engulfment. With the mouth empty, a distinct, centrally furrowed tongue was present in all three species. The nonlingual intermandibular lining ran outwards from the root of the tongue to attach along the ventral border of the mandibles. The cavum ventrale extended anteriorly beneath the tongue and nonlingual intermandibular lining from the cervico-thoracic region. By simple manipulation, the tongue could be transformed into a hollow, sac-like structure invaginating the cervical portion of the cavum ventrale. During this transformation, the nonlingual intermandibular lining was stretched posteriorly to completely cover the floor of the mouth. When the mouth of a suspended B. acutorostrata specimen (head only) was filled with water to simulate engulfment the tongue and nonlingual intermandibular lining expanded through the transected space of the cavum ventrale to form a capacious \"oral sac.\" The posteriodorsal wall of this sac was formed by what had been the tongue. Adaptations that enhance the expansibility of the oral sac include a highly elastic connective fiber matrix and a redundant surface created by epithelial corrugations and the tongue's central furrow. It is concluded that 1) during engulfment the tongue would initiate distension of the cavum ventrale by everting through the floor of the mouth between the cavum's inner and outer walls, 2) the everted, elastic tongue would act to enlarge the capacity of the mouth, and 3) the sac lining of the cavum ventrale at the end of engulfment would be created by the tongue and nonlingual intermandibular lining.]","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,15]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Lambertsen","given":"Richard H."}],"citation-key":"lambertsen83","container-title":"Journal of Mammalogy","DOI":"10.2307/1380752","ISSN":"0022-2372","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1983]]},"page":"76-88","source":"JSTOR","title":"Internal Mechanism of Rorqual Feeding","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1380752","volume":"64"},
  {"id":"lasorte_etal16","abstract":"Mid-latitude climate extremes are projected to increase in frequency under global climate change. How this may affect migratory bird populations is not well understood. The mid-latitudes of North America experienced an extreme warming event during March 2012 that advanced the spring phenology of ecological productivity, resulting in lower levels of productivity during the summer. Here, we test the predictions that: (1) short-distance migratory birds, due to geographic proximity and more flexible migratory behavior, should advance their spring migration phenology; and (2) breeding populations, due to lower summer productivity, should have reduced occurrences. We used occurrence data for 353 bird species from the eBird database to calculate weekly occurrence anomalies for 2012 relative to the 2010–2014 average. We identified species having unusually large positive occurrence anomalies during March 2012 and species having unusually large negative occurrence anomalies during July–August 2012. For each category, we summarized migration strategies, geographic distributions, and annual associations with temperature and ecological productivity. Short-distance migrants whose winter and breeding ranges intersect the mid-latitudes advanced their spring migration phenology during March (n = 21). Long-distance migrants whose winter and breeding distributions were weakly associated with the mid-latitudes had lower occurrences during the summer (n = 32). Five species were shared between the two categories. Within species’ winter ranges, temperature and ecological productivity were higher than expected during March; within species’ breeding ranges, ecological productivity was lower than expected during the summer. These differences were strongest for the 21 short-distance migrants. Following our expectations, mid-latitude climate extremes and associated ecological consequences broadly affected avian migration and breeding activities within the region. Our findings suggest short-distance migrants are more flexible and resilient, whereas populations of long-distance migrants are at a distinct disadvantage, which may intensify if the frequency of these events increases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"La Sorte","given":"Frank A."},{"family":"Hochachka","given":"Wesley M."},{"family":"Farnsworth","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Dhondt","given":"André A."},{"family":"Sheldon","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"lasorte_etal16","container-title":"Ecosphere","DOI":"10.1002/ecs2.1261","ISSN":"2150-8925","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"e01261","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The implications of mid-latitude climate extremes for North American migratory bird populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecs2.1261","volume":"7"},

Information on their individual movement and distribution patterns is largely unknown due to their association with sea ice habitat where direct observations are limited. The primary objectives of this study are (1) to use satellite telemetry to quantify the movement patterns, distribution, and presumed foraging areas of Antarctic minke whales and (2) to assess the environmental conditions that are associated with areas used by minke whales along the western Antarctic Peninsula.\nResults:  Individual movement patterns from three Antarctic minke whales fitted with ARGOS-linked transmitters were analyzed with respect to environmental conditions. Behavioral states were identified using the Multi-Scale Straightness Index. Satellite telemetry revealed disparate behavioral patterns between these three individuals. Generalized additive model analysis demonstrated environmental variables, particularly sea ice, bathymetry, and sea surface temperature, are the best predictors of presumed foraging areas.\nConclusions:  Satellite telemetry from three individuals revealed Antarctic minke whale summer foraging spaces are highly individualized but can generally be associated with pack ice habitat over the continental shelf. The coupled relationship between minke whales, krill, and sea ice suggests that these whales may be sensitive to changes in sea ice concentration, extent, and duration, making them particularly vulnerable to climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Jessica F."},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari S."},{"family":"Oliver","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"DeLiberty","given":"Tracy L."}],"citation-key":"lee_etal17","container-title":"Animal Biotelemetry","DOI":"10.1186/s40317-017-0138-7","ISSN":"2050-3385","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","source":"Crossref","title":"Behavior of satellite-tracked Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) in relation to environmental factors around the western Antarctic Peninsula","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://animalbiotelemetry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40317-017-0138-7","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"leeseberg_keeley14","abstract":"Growth and maximum size of stream fishes can be highly variable across populations. For salmonid fishes in streams, individuals from populations confined to headwater streams often exhibit small size at maturity in comparison to populations with access to main-stem rivers. Differences in prey size, prey availability, and metabolic constraints based on temperature may explain patterns of maximum size and growth. In this study, cutthroat trout from headwater stream populations that were isolated above a waterfall were compared to individuals from populations in similar sized streams without a movement barrier and from large main-stem rivers. Cutthroat trout from smaller streams with or without a movement barrier were significantly smaller at a given age than fish from main-stem rivers, where individuals were able to achieve a much larger maximum size. Comparisons of invertebrate drift abundance and size in the three types of streams revealed that drift size did not differ between stream categories, but was highest per volume of water in large main-stem rivers. Across all stream types, prey abundance declined from summer to fall. Temperature declined over the course of the season in a similar manner across all stream types, but remained relatively high later in the season in main-stem river habitats. Prey availability and temperature conditions in main-stem rivers may provide more optimal growing conditions for fish as individuals increase in size and become constrained by prey availability and temperature conditions in small streams. Maintaining connectivity between small spawning and rearing tributary streams and main-stem river habitats may be critical in maintaining large-bodied populations of stream salmonids.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Leeseberg","given":"Christopher A."},{"family":"Keeley","given":"Ernest R."}],"citation-key":"leeseberg_keeley14","container-title":"Environmental Biology of Fishes","container-title-short":"Environ Biol Fish","DOI":"10.1007/s10641-014-0219-x","ISSN":"1573-5133","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","page":"599-614","source":"Springer Link","title":"Prey size, prey abundance, and temperature as correlates of growth in stream populations of cutthroat trout","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10641-014-0219-x","volume":"97"},
  {"id":"lefebvre_etal02","abstract":"Abstract Tools are traditionally defined as objects that are used as an extension of the body and held directly in the hand or mouth. By these standards, a vulture breaking an egg by hitting it with a stone uses a tool, but a gull dropping an egg on a rock does not. This distinction between true and borderline (or proto-tool) cases has been criticized for its arbitrariness and anthropocentrism. We show here that relative size of the neostriatum and whole brain distinguish the true and borderline categories in birds using tools to obtain food or water. From two sources, the specialized literature on tools and an innovation data base gathered in the short note sections of 68 journals in 7 areas of the world, we collected 39 true (e.g. use of probes, hammers, sponges, scoops) and 86 borderline (e.g. bait fishing, battering and dropping on anvils, holding with wedges and skewers) cases of tool use in 104 species from 15 parvorders. True tool users have a larger mean residual brain size (regressed against body weight) than do users of borderline tools, confirming the distinction in the literature. In multiple regressions, residual brain size and residual size of the neostriatum (one of the areas in the avian telencephalon thought to be equivalent to the mammalian neocortex) are the best predictors of true tool use reports per taxon. Innovation rate is the best predictor of borderline tool use distribution. Despite the strong concentration of true tool use cases in Corvida and Passerida, independent constrasts suggest that common ancestry is not responsible for the association between tool use and size of the neostriatum and whole brain. Our results demonstrate that birds are more frequent tool users than usually thought and that the complex cognitive processes involved in tool use may have repeatedly co-evolved with large brains in several orders of birds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Lefebvre","given":"Louis"},{"family":"Nicolakakis","given":"Nektaria"},{"family":"Boire","given":"Denis"}],"citation-key":"lefebvre_etal02","container-title":"Behaviour","DOI":"10.1163/156853902320387918","ISSN":"0005-7959, 1568-539X","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"language":"en","page":"939-973","publisher":"Brill","source":"brill.com","title":"Tools and brains in birds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/view/journals/beh/139/7/article-p939_6.xml","volume":"139"},

There is no information as to relative frequencies of occurrence of spiral as opposed to circular bubble nets, or nets of other geometries. However the spiral net offers several distinct advantages over the circular one in terms of the generation of an acoustic trap, containing some regions of bubble-free water which will be quiet when the whales insonifies the net with feeding calls. These advantages are demonstrated through simulation, and a physical scale model was used to demonstrate some of these features.","author":[{"family":"Leighton","given":"Timothy G"},{"family":"Finfer","given":"Daniel C"},{"family":"Grover","given":"Edward J"},{"family":"White","given":"Paul R"}],"citation-key":"leighton_etal","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Spiral Bubble Nets of Humpback Whales: An Acoustic Mechanism","type":"article-journal"},

A first step is to measure individual and aggregation behaviour. We report on successful use of a robust, low-cost underwater stereo video camera system to observe live Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in aquaria. The application of photogrammetry techniques allows animal length, orientation and three-dimen- sional position to be calculated from stereo video camera observations. Initially, we tested the efficacy of the stereo system by observing synthetic targets of known length and orientation to obtain estimates of measurement error. We found that on average the stereo camera system underestimated length by 0.6 mm and vertical tilt angle by +0.34 ̊ (head up), but that photogrammetric measurements of 100 randomly selected krill lengths were not significantly different from measurements of 100 randomly caught krill measured physically. During our investigation, we analysed three krill behavioural metrics: swimming speed, tortuosity, and vertical orientation under three behavioural states (undisturbed, feeding, and escape). We found that swim speed and tortuosity significantly increased when animals were feeding or exhibiting an escape response, but vertical orientation was not significantly different across states. Our investigation demonstrates that low-cost stereo video cameras can produce precise measurements that can be used for monitoring krill behaviour and population structure.","author":[{"family":"Letessier","given":"Tom"},{"family":"King","given":"Rob"},{"family":"Meeuwig","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Harcourt","given":"Rob"},{"family":"Cox","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"letessier_etal13","container-title":"Open Journal of Marine Science","container-title-short":"Open Journal of Marine Science","DOI":"10.4236/ojms.2013.33016","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"page":"148-153","source":"ResearchGate","title":"A Robust and Economical Underwater Stereo Video System to Observe Antarctic Krill (Euphausia superba)","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"linsky_etal20","abstract":"Background:  Advances in biologging technology allow researchers access to previously unobservable behavioral states and movement patterns of marine animals. To relate behaviors with environmental variables, features must be evaluated at scales relevant to the animal or behavior. Remotely sensed environmental data, collected via satellites, often suffers from the effects of cloud cover and lacks the spatial or temporal resolution to adequately link with individual animal behaviors or behavioral bouts. This study establishes a new method for remotely and continuously quantifying surface ice concentration (SIC) at a scale relevant to individual whales using on-animal tag video data.\nResults:  Motion-sensing and video-recording suction cup tags were deployed on 7 Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) around the Antarctic Peninsula in February and March of 2018. To compare the scale of camera-tag observations with satellite imagery, the area of view was simulated using camera-tag parameters. For expected conditions, we found the visible area maximum to be ~ 100m2 which indicates that observations occur at an equivalent or finer scale than a single pixel of high-resolution visible spectrum satellite imagery. SIC was classified into one of six bins (0%, 1–20%, 21–40%, 41–60%, 61–80%, 81–100%) by two independent observers for the initial and final surfacing between dives. In the event of a disagreement, a third independent observer was introduced, and the median of the three observer’s values was used. Initial results (n = 6) show that Antarctic minke whales in the coastal bays of the Antarctic Peninsula spend 52% of their time in open water, and only 15% of their time in water with SIC greater than 20%. Over time, we find significant variation in observed SIC, indicating that Antarctic minke occupy an extremely dynamic environment. Sentinel-2 satellite-based approaches of sea ice assessment were not possible because of persistent cloud cover during the study period.\nConclusion:  Tag-video offers a means to evaluate ice concentration at spatial and temporal scales relevant to the individual. Combined with information on underwater behavior, our ability to quantify SIC continuously at the scale of the animal will improve upon current remote sensing methods to understand the link between animal behavior and these dynamic environmental variables.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Linsky","given":"Jacob M.

  {"id":"lockyer_etal84","abstract":"Fin whale blubber is a heterogenous tissue containing 8.9–77.4% lipid, 3.1–33.8% protein, and 0.07–0.73% ash by wet weight. The blubber may be subdivided into three macroscopically distinct zones. The outermost zones contain up to twice the lipid content of the innermost zone adjacent to the muscle, which contains more protein. Anterior ventral blubber contains less lipid, more protein (of which 50% is collagen), and more ash than posterior dorsal blubber. Foetal blubber contains 1.2% lipid, 10.6% protein, and 0.93% ash by wet weight. Blubber lipid contains ca. 60% triacylglycerol and ca. 25–30% free fatty acid, compared with ca. 25% triacylglycerol and ca. 10% free fatty acid in foetal blubber lipid, which also contains ca. 40% phospholipid. The high free fatty acid component is certainly partly due to postmortem hydrolysis in samples analysed. Monounsaturated fatty acids comprise ca. 60% of blubber lipid; 16:0, 16:1, 18:1, 20:1, 22:1, and 22:6 predominate, similar to the dietary intake. The predominant fatty acids in the outermost and the innermost blubber zones are 22:1 and 16:0, respectively.

Data from the past whaling industry in Iceland for fin whales, the Faroese ‘grindedrap’ for pilot whales, and by-catches as well as some live captive studies for harbour porpoise have been used. The studies demonstrate how information can be gathered to compile energy budgets for individuals, relying on carcase measurement and analysis, dietary investigations, biochemical analyses of tissues, and general life history studies including reproduction; as well as from monitoring living animals. The individual examples presented show how food energy storage in the form of fat can be variously important in insulation in the smallest species to controlling reproductive efficiency in large migratory species.

Although in some studies, the relationships between migration distance and breeding success or annual survival are established, none has investigated whether mortality during the actual migration increases with migration distance. Here, we compared seasonal survival between Eurasian spoonbills (Platalea leucorodia leucorodia) that breed in The Netherlands and migrate different distances (ca 1000, 2000 and 4500 km) to winter in France, Iberia and Mauritania, respectively. On the basis of resightings of individually marked birds throughout the year between 2005 and 2012, we show that summer, autumn and winter survival were very high and independent of migration distance, whereas mortality during spring migration was much higher (18%) for the birds that wintered in Mauritania, compared with those flying only as far as France (5%) or Iberia (6%). As such, this study is the first to show empirical evidence for increased mortality during some long migrations, likely driven by the presence of a physical barrier (the Sahara desert) in combination with suboptimal fuelling and unfavourable weather conditions en route.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Lok","given":"Tamar"},{"family":"Overdijk","given":"Otto"},{"family":"Piersma","given":"Theunis"}],"citation-key":"lok_etal15","container-title":"Biology Letters","DOI":"10.1098/rsbl.2014.0944","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,1]]},"page":"20140944","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"The cost of migration: spoonbills suffer higher mortality during trans-Saharan spring migrations only","title-short":"The cost of migration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsbl.2014.0944","volume":"11"},

Data collected from 2001 to 2018 in waters between the islands of Maui, Moloka’i, Lana’i, and Kaho’olawe (the Four-Island area), support the assumption that humpback whales are more vulnerable to small-vessel collision during their first year(s) of life. This, along with four incidents of first-hand observation of calves with significant wounds likely resulting from propellers were the impetus for further investigation into calf vulnerability to vessel collision in Hawaiian waters. We examined underwater video footage of mother/calf groups to investigate calf-surfacing events with or without the\nmother, as well as the calf behavior displayed while at or near the surface. We defined three depth zones: Depth A (<5 meters [m]), Depth B (5-10 m), and Depth C (>10 m). We considered Depth A the small-vessel collision vulnerability zone based on the approximate body length of a calf, and the depth at which a small-vessel draft (i.e., hull or propeller) could make contact with the calf at or below the surface. We analyzed 3,022 30-second samples of underwater video footage from 226 mother/calf resting groups. It was possible for the calf to be in more than one Depth Zone during an interval when moving from deeper water to surface water or surface water to deeper water which resulted in a total of 3,499 samples of which 1,422 (40.6%) the calf was in Depth A, 592 (17.0%) the calf was in Depth B and 1485 (42.4%) the calf was in Depth C. Of the samples having calves in Depth A, there were 509 samples (36%) of calves surfacing alone, 532 samples (37%) of calves surfacing with the mother and 381 samples (27%) where calves did not break the surface. In Depth A, calves were found to exhibit rest behavior significantly more than other behaviors (χ2 = 1,430.1, df\n= 3, p < 0.001, n = 1,422).

  {"id":"long_etal02","abstract":"To determine the possible locomotor functions of the hagﬁsh notochord, we measured its ﬂexural stiffness EI (N m–2) and ﬂexural damping C (kg m3 s–1), under in vitro conditions that mimicked the body curvature and bending frequency measured during steady undulatory swimming. To assess the notochord’s contribution to the mechanical behavior of the whole body, we also measured EI and C of the whole body, the body with skin removed, and the notochord with the outer ﬁbrous sheath removed. When subjected to dynamic bending at angular frequencies from π to 6π rad s–1 and midline curvatures from 11 to 40 m–1, 1 cm in situ body segments (N=4), located at an axial position of 37% of the body length, showed signiﬁcant changes in EI, C, the Young’s modulus or material stiffness (E, MPa), the net work to bend the body over a cycle (W, J) and resilience (R, % energy return). When skin, muscles and the outer ﬁbrous sheath of the notochord were removed sequentially, each structural reduction yielded signiﬁcant changes in mechanical properties: C decreased when the skin was removed, E increased when the muscles were removed, and EI and R decreased when the outer ﬁbrous sheath was removed. Although occupying only a small portion of the crosssectional area, the notochord provides the body with 75% of its total EI and 80% of total C, by virtue of its high E, ranging from 4 to 8 MPa, which is an order of magnitude greater than that of the whole body. Thus, as the body’s primary source of EI and C, the notochord determines the passive (i.e. internal, non-muscular) mechanical behavior of the swimming hagﬁsh. EI and C covary inversely and non-linearly such that as C increases, EI decreases. However, the bending moments M (N m) produced by each property increase proportionally, and the ratio of stiffness to damping moments, also known as the ampliﬁcation ratio at resonance, is nearly invariant (approximately 7) with changes in driving frequency. If the body operates in life at or near resonance, the variables EI and C interact over a range of swimming speeds to produce passive mechanical stability.","author":[{"family":"Long","given":"J.H."},{"family":"Koob-Emunds","given":"M."},{"family":"Sinwell","given":"B."},{"family":"Koob","given":"T.J."}],"citation-key":"long_etal02","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Biology","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"language":"en","page":"3819-3831","source":"Zotero","title":"The notochord of hagfish Myxine glutinosa: visco-elastic properties and mechanical functions during steady swimming","type":"article-journal","volume":"205"},

  {"id":"lopez_etal19","abstract":"Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) have a global distribution, but the population inhabiting the Gulf of California (GoC) is thought to be geographically and genetically isolated. However, their distribution and movements are poorly known. The goal of this study was to describe fin whale movements for the first time from 11 Argos satellite tags deployed in the southwest GoC in March 2001. A Bayesian Switching State-Space Model was applied to obtain improved locations and to characterize movement behavior as either “area-restricted searching” (indicative of patch residence, ARS) or “transiting” (indicative of moving between patches). Model performance was assessed with convergence diagnostics and by examining the distribution of the deviance and the behavioral parameters from Markov Chain Monte Carlo models. ARS was the predominant mode behavior 83% of the time during both the cool (December-May) and warm seasons (June-November), with slower travel speeds (mean = 0.84 km/h) than during transiting mode (mean = 3.38 km/h). We suggest ARS mode indicates either foraging activities (year around) or reproductive activities during the winter (cool season). We tagged during the cool season, when the whales were located in the Loreto-La Paz Corridor in the southwestern GoC, close to the shoreline. As the season progressed, individuals moved northward to the Midriff Islands and the upper gulf for the warm season, much farther from shore. One tag lasted long enough to document a whale’s return to Loreto the following cool season. One whale that was originally of undetermined sex, was tagged in the Bay of La Paz and was photographed 10 years later with a calf in the nearby San Jose Channel, suggesting seasonal site fidelity. The tagged whales moved along the western GoC to the upper gulf seasonally and did not transit to the eastern GoC south of the Midriff Islands. No tagged whales left the GoC, providing supporting evidence that these fin whales are a resident population.","author":[{"family":"López","given":"M.

The objectives were to: (1) identify the proportion of harvested whales that had been feeding; and (2) describe the diet based on stomach contents. Data used were field records for 242 whales whose stomachs were examined and laboratory analysis of samples from 123 animals. There were no significant differences in the proportions of animals that had been feeding during the autumn at Kaktovik (83%) and Barrow (75%), or in sub-adults (78%) versus adults (73%). Copepods occurred significantly more frequently in animals from Kaktovik, while euphausiids and hyperiid amphipods occurred more frequently at Barrow. During the autumn, the percent copepods by volume was greater in animals taken at Kaktovik than at Barrow, while the percent euphausiids by volume was greater in whales taken at Barrow. At Barrow, a larger proportion of animals was feeding in the autumn (76%) than the spring (34%), and copepods occurred more often in the spring. Examination of five whales taken at Nuiqsut in the autumn suggests a feeding pattern similar to that seen at Kaktovik. There were no significant differences in diets of males versus females or of sub-adults versus adults. It is concluded that in the autumn, bowheads feed regularly in the eastern, central and western Alaskan Beaufort Sea, and that feeding during the spring migration is more common than previously thought.","author":[{"family":"Lowry","given":"Lloyd F"},{"family":"Sheffield","given":"Gay"},{"family":"George","given":"John Craighead"}],"citation-key":"lowry_etal04","container-title":"Journal of Cetacean Research and Management","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"language":"en","page":"215-223","source":"Zotero","title":"Bowhead whale feeding in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, based on stomach contents analyses","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},

We present a new methodology using ocean heat content (OHC), a habitat metric that is normally a fundamental part of hurricane intensity forecasting, to estimate movements and migration of satellite-tagged marine fishes. Previous satellite-tagging research of fishes using archival depth, temperature and light data for geolocations have been too coarse to resolve detailed ocean habitat utilization. We combined tag data with OHC estimated from ocean circulation and transport models in an optimization framework that substantially improved geolocation accuracy over SST-based tracks. The OHC-based movement track provided the first quantitative evidence that many of the tagged highly migratory fishes displayed affinities for ocean fronts and eddies. The OHC method provides a new quantitative tool for studying dynamic use of ocean habitats, migration processes and responses to environmental changes by fishes, and further, improves ocean animal tracking and extends satellite-based animal tracking data for other potential physical, ecological, and fisheries applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Luo","given":"Jiangang"},{"family":"Ault","given":"Jerald S."},{"family":"Shay","given":"Lynn K."},{"family":"Hoolihan","given":"John P."},{"family":"Prince","given":"Eric D."},{"family":"Brown","given":"Craig A."},{"family":"Rooker","given":"Jay R."}],"citation-key":"luo_etal15","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0141101","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,10,20]]},"language":"en","page":"e0141101","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Ocean Heat Content Reveals Secrets of Fish Migrations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141101","volume":"10"},

In this study, we instrumented 25 fin whales with ARGOS satellite-transmitters in Svalbard, Norway, to study their movement patterns and behaviour (Area Restricted Search (ARS), transiting or unknown) during boreal autumn/early winter. Ten of the whales stayed in the tagging area (most northerly location: 81.68°N) for their entire tracking periods (max 45 days).

The whales engaged in ARS behaviour intermittently throughout their southward migrations. During transit phases the whales moved quickly; one individual maintained an average horizontal speed of 9.3 km/h (travelling 223 km per day) for a period of a week. This study documents that: (1) some fin whales might remain at high latitudes during winter; (2) the whales that do migrate probably feed along the way; (3) they can maintain high transiting speed for long periods and; (4) one breeding area for this species is likely located in deep, warm water some 100 km west of Morocco.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Lydersen","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Vacquié-Garcia","given":"Jade"},{"family":"Heide-Jørgensen","given":"Mads Peter"},{"family":"Øien","given":"Nils"},{"family":"Guinet","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Kovacs","given":"Kit M."}],"citation-key":"lydersen_etal20","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-020-73996-z","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","license":"2020 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"16966","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Autumn movements of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) from Svalbard, Norway, revealed by satellite tracking","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73996-z","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"mach_etal07","abstract":"Summary Biomechanical analyses of intertidal and shallow subtidal seaweeds have elucidated ways in which these organisms avoid breakage in the presence of exceptional hydrodynamic forces imposed by pounding surf. However, comparison of algal material properties to maximum hydrodynamic forces predicts lower rates of breakage and dislodgment than are actually observed. Why the disparity between prediction and reality? Most previous research has measured algal material properties during a single application of force, equivalent to a single wave rushing past an alga. In contrast, intertidal macroalgae may experience more than 8000 waves a day. This repeated loading can cause cracks – introduced, for example, by herbivory or abrasion – to grow and eventually cause breakage, yet fatigue crack growth has not previously been taken into account. Here, we present methods from the engineering field of fracture mechanics that can be used to assess consequences of repeated force imposition for seaweeds. These techniques allow quantification of crack growth in wave-swept macroalgae, a first step towards considering macroalgal breakage in the realistic context of repeated force imposition. These analyses can also be applied to many other soft materials.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Mach","given":"K. J."},{"family":"Nelson","given":"D.

Here, we review aquatic tool use and examine the contributing ecological, physiological, cognitive and social factors. Tool use among aquatic animals is rare but taxonomically diverse, occurring in fish, cephalopods, mammals, crabs, urchins and possibly gastropods. While additional research is required, the scarcity of tool use can likely be attributable to the characteristics of aquatic habitats, which are generally not conducive to tool use. Nonetheless, studying tool use by aquatic animals provides insights into the conditions that promote and inhibit tool-use behaviour across biomes. Like land-based tool users, aquatic animals tend to find tools on the substrate and use tools during foraging. However, unlike on land, tool users in water often use other animals (and their products) and water itself as a tool. Among sea otters and dolphins, the two aquatic tool users studied in greatest detail, some individuals specialize in tool use, which is vertically socially transmitted possibly because of their long dependency periods. In all, the contrasts between aquatic- and land-based tool users enlighten our understanding of the adaptive value of tool-use behaviour.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Mann","given":"Janet"},{"family":"Patterson","given":"Eric M."}],"citation-key":"mann_patterson13","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2012.0424","issue":"1630","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"page":"20120424","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Tool use by aquatic animals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2012.0424","volume":"368"},

Until recently, much of what we knew about cetaceans came from commercial sources such as whalers and trainers for dolphin acts. Innovative research methods and persistent efforts, however, have begun to penetrate the depths to reveal tantalizing glimpses of the lives of these mammals in their natural habitats.  Cetacean Societies presents the first comprehensive synthesis and review of these new studies. Groups of chapters focus on the history of cetacean behavioral research and methodology; state-of-the-art reviews of information on four of the most-studied species: bottlenose dolphins, killer whales, sperm whales, and humpback whales; and summaries of major topics, including group living, male and female reproductive strategies, communication, and conservation drawn from comparative research on a wide range of species.  Written by some of the world's leading cetacean scientists, this landmark volume will benefit not just students of cetology but also researchers in other areas of behavioral and conservation ecology as well as anyone with a serious interest in the world of whales and dolphins.

  {"id":"martin_etal08","abstract":"Animals living in temporally dynamic environments experience variation in resource availability, climate and threat of infection over the course of the year. Thus, to survive and reproduce successfully, these organisms must allocate resources among competing physiological systems in such a way as to maximize fitness in changing environments. Here, we review evidence supporting the hypothesis that physiological trade-offs, particularly those between the reproductive and immune systems, mediate part of the seasonal changes detected in the immune defences of many vertebrates. Abundant recent work has detected significant energetic and nutritional costs of immune defence. Sometimes these physiological costs are sufficiently large to affect fitness (e.g. reproductive output, growth or survival), indicating that selection for appropriate allocation strategies probably occurred in the past. Because hormones often orchestrate allocations among physiological systems, the endocrine mediators of seasonal changes in immune activity are discussed. Many hormones, including melatonin, glucocorticoids and androgens have extensive and consistent effects on the immune system, and they change in systematic fashions over the year. Finally, a modified framework within which to conduct future studies in ecological immunology is proposed, viz. a heightened appreciation of the complex but intelligible nature of the vertebrate immune system. Although other factors besides trade-offs undoubtedly influence seasonal variation in immune defence in animals, a growing literature supports a role for physiological trade-offs and the fitness consequences they sometimes produce.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Martin","given":"Lynn B"},{"family":"Weil","given":"Zachary M"},{"family":"Nelson","given":"Randy J"}],"citation-key":"martin_etal08","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Phil.

  {"id":"martin_maclarnon85","abstract":"Two factors complicate the analysis of scaling relationships between neonatal size or gestation period and maternal size in mammals: (1) a fundamental distinction between species with poorly-developed (altricial) neonates and those with well-developed (precocial) neonates; (2) interaction between all three variables. We show here that altricial and precocial mammals can be clearly distinguished by gestation period relative to maternal weight. Separate analysis of the three variables for altricial and precocial mammals yields more appropriate allometric formulae which can in turn be related to a standard fetal growth formula derived from single-species studies. Hence, an overall equation can be derived across species which links neonatal weight to a combined function of gestation period and a fetal growth parameter. The latter, which provides a measure of maternal investment, is a constant for each species but varies allometrically with maternal weight across species1. Analysis of the fetal growth parameter across species shows that altricial mammals generally have a higher maternal investment for a given gestation period and maternal weight than precocial mammals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Martin","given":"R.

  {"id":"martinlopez_etal15","abstract":"Diving animals modulate their swimming gaits to promote locomotor efficiency and so enable longer, more productive dives. Beaked whales perform extremely long and deep foraging dives that probably exceed aerobic capacities for some species. Here, we use biomechanical data from suction-cup tags attached to three species of beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris, N=10; Ziphius cavirostris, N=9; and Hyperoodon ampullatus, N=2) to characterize their swimming gaits. In addition to continuous stroking and strokeand-glide gaits described for other diving mammals, all whales produced occasional fluke-strokes with distinctly larger dorsoventral acceleration, which we termed ‘type-B’ strokes. These high-power strokes occurred almost exclusively during deep dive ascents as part of a novel mixed gait. To quantify body rotations and specific acceleration generated during strokes we adapted a kinematic method combining data from two sensors in the tag. Body rotations estimated with high-rate magnetometer data were subtracted from accelerometer data to estimate the resulting surge and heave accelerations. Using this method, we show that stroke duration, rotation angle and acceleration were bi-modal for these species, with B-strokes having 76% of the duration, 52% larger body rotation and four times more surge than normal strokes. The additional acceleration of B-strokes did not lead to faster ascents, but rather enabled brief glides, which may improve the overall efficiency of this gait. Their occurrence towards the end of long dives leads us to propose that B-strokes may recruit fast-twitch fibres that comprise ∼80% of swimming muscles in Blainville’s beaked whales, thus prolonging foraging time at depth.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Martin López","given":"L.

On-animal accelerometers measure both orientation and SA but an additional orientation sensor is needed to accurately separate these. Although gyroscopes can perform this function, their power consumption, drift and complex data processing make them unattractive for biologging. Lower power magnetometers can also be used with some limitations. Here, we present an integrated and simplified method for estimating body rotations and SA applicable to both gyroscopes and magnetometers, enabling a direct comparison of these two sensors. We use a tag with both sensors to demonstrate how caudal-oscillation rate and SA are adjusted by a diving whale in response to rapidly changing buoyancy forces as the lungs compress while descending. The two sensors gave similar estimates of the dynamic forces, demonstrating that magnetometers may offer a simpler low-power alternative for miniature tags in some applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Martín López","given":"Lucía Martina"},{"family":"Aguilar de Soto","given":"Natacha"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"martinlopez_etal16","container-title":"The Journal of Experimental Biology","DOI":"10.1242/jeb.136242","ISSN":"0022-0949, 1477-9145","issue":"14","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"2103-2109","source":"Crossref","title":"Tracking the kinematics of caudal-oscillatory swimming: a comparison of two on-animal sensing methods","title-short":"Tracking the kinematics of caudal-oscillatory swimming","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://jeb.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jeb.136242","volume":"219"},
  {"id":"martinlopez_etal22","abstract":"Acceleration-based proxies for activity and energy expenditure are widely used in bio-logging studies of animal movement and locomotion to explore biomechanical strategies, energetic costs of behaviour, habitat use and the impact of anthropogenic disturbance. The foremost such proxy is overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) along with variants VeDBA and PDBA. This technique, which involves summing the magnitude of high-pass-filtered acceleration signals (the so-called dynamic acceleration) over a reference interval, has been applied to animals as diverse as shags, lobsters, humans and whales. The relationship between ODBA and energy use has been tested empirically on animals small enough to house in laboratory facilities and arguments have been offered for why the method should be generally applicable; however, validations on larger animals are scant. Here, we examine how body size impacts ODBA and its variants under steady locomotion in large aquatic animals, using cetaceans as model species. To do this, we first develop a simplified mathematical model for the acceleration signals that would be measured by a tag on a swimming animal. We then test this model with empirical data gathered using bio-logging tags on whale species spanning 1.3 m harbour porpoises to 12-m sperm whales. We show that the motions measured by ODBA can be fundamentally different in small versus large aquatic animals. Whereas dynamic acceleration in small animals is predominantly due to specific acceleration (i.e. actual accelerative motions generated by muscle action), in larger aquatic animals, body rotations (i.e. cyclical angular displacements associated with swimming) can dominate the measured acceleration. As body rotations do not necessarily increase in magnitude as swimming speed increases, ODBA may underestimate the relative cost of behaviours or responses to disturbance in large aquatic animals. This does not lessen the value of ODBA for small animals, but it raises a caution against uncritical use on larger animals. For large aquatic animals, activity proxies that specifically remove body rotations using gyroscopes or magnetometers may provide more consistent estimates of energy use although these methods are yet to be validated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Martín López","given":"Lucía Martina"},{"family":"Aguilar de Soto","given":"Natacha"},{"family":"Madsen","given":"Peter T."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"martinlopez_etal22","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.13751","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"language":"en","page":"447-458","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Overall dynamic body acceleration measures activity differently on large versus small aquatic animals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.13751","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"mastick_etal22","abstract":"In many species, group foraging is a strategy used to increase the efficiency of individuals to find and exploit patchy prey. Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are one of the few baleen whale species reported to use coordinated foraging strategies. One of these behaviors, bubble-net feeding, has been observed in several populations, though the behaviors of individuals within these groups are largely unknown. This study used multisensor kinematic tag data from 26 whales foraging in the Southern Gulf of Maine to analyze individual bubble-net feeding behaviors. Linear mixed effects models were used to test if there were differences in individual whales' dive behaviors across group size. The results indicate that individuals performed consistent bubble-net feeding behaviors regardless of the size of their foraging group, except when using one specific foraging behavior, the upward spiral. Overall complexity of foraging dives, based on the three-dimensional movements of the dive, decreased with increasing group size when group members used upward spirals. This may indicate that in larger groups, participants in coordinated feeding events need to move less and expend less energy to corral prey. This study provides new insights into the effects of group size on individual behavior and group coordination in humpback whales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Mastick","given":"Natalie C."},{"family":"Wiley","given":"David"},{"family":"Cade","given":"David E."},{"family":"Ware","given":"Colin"},{"family":"Parks","given":"Susan E."},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari S."}],"citation-key":"mastick_etal22","container-title":"Marine Mammal Science","DOI":"10.1111/mms.12905","ISSN":"1748-7692","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"language":"en","page":"959-974","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The effect of group size on individual behavior of bubble-net feeding humpback whales in the southern Gulf of Maine","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mms.12905","volume":"38"},
  {"id":"mate_etal07","abstract":"Despite several centuries of whaling and directed research, there are only a few whale stocks whose year-round whereabouts are reasonably well known. For the vast majority of depleted populations, the link between seasonal feeding and breeding concentrations remains unknown. This lack of information on range, seasonal distribution, stock structure, and migration routes makes it difficult to design and implement effective conservation measures to promote recovery. The use of such information would have been valuable to develop stock-specific quotas for whaling, but now it may be even more important for recovery of depleted stocks and identifying anthropogenic threats throughout a depleted stock's range. Building upon the preliminary findings of Discovery tags and more recent photo identification studies, satellite-monitored radio tags are now providing range and seasonal distribution information for many stocks of depleted large whales. These parameters are important to better estimate population abundance, characterize habitats, identify threats to recovery, and design effective protection measures when needed. This paper traces one laboratory's experience with the development of satellite-monitored radio tag technology for large whales, including attachment mechanisms and delivery systems, in the hope that others will profit from our successes and our mistakes. Selected examples are used to demonstrate how such tags contribute to new insights about whales’ habitats, migrations, behaviour, and management.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Mate","given":"Bruce"},{"family":"Mesecar","given":"Roderick"},{"family":"Lagerquist","given":"Barbara"}],"citation-key":"mate_etal07","collection-title":"Bio-logging Science: Logging and Relaying Physical and Biological Data Using Animal-Attached Tags","container-title":"Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography","container-title-short":"Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography","DOI":"10.1016/j.dsr2.2006.11.021","ISSN":"0967-0645","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"en","page":"224-247","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The evolution of satellite-monitored radio tags for large whales: One laboratory's experience","title-short":"The evolution of satellite-monitored radio tags for large whales","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064507000069","volume":"54"},

A female with the longest-lasting tag visited all three major EGW reproductive areas off Baja California, Mexico, before returning to Sakhalin Island the following spring. Her 22 511 km round-trip is the longest documented mammal migration and strongly suggests that some presumed WGWs are actually EGWs foraging in areas historically attributed to WGWs.

In addition, the impacts of COVID-19 permeate into our environment and wildlife as well. Here, we discuss the essential role of wastewater treatment and management during these times. A consequence of poor wastewater management is the discharge of untreated wastewater carrying infectious SARS-CoV-2 into natural water systems that are home to marine mammals. Here, we predict the susceptibility of marine mammal species using a modelling approach. We identiﬁed that many species of whale, dolphin and seal, as well as otters, are predicted to be highly susceptible to infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In addition, geo-mapping highlights how current wastewater management in Alaska may lead to susceptible marine mammal populations being exposed to the virus. Localities such as Cold Bay, Naknek, Dillingham and Palmer may require additional treatment of their wastewater to prevent virus spillover through sewage. Since over half of these susceptibility species are already at risk worldwide, the release of the virus via untreated wastewater could have devastating consequences for their already declining populations. For these reasons, we discuss approaches that can be taken by the public, policymakers and wastewater treatment facilities to reduce the risk of virus spillover in our natural water systems. Thus, we indicate the potential for reverse zoonotic transmission of COVID-19 and its impact on marine wildlife; impacts that can be mitigated with appropriate action to prevent further damage to these vulnerable populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Mathavarajah","given":"Sabateeshan"},{"family":"Stoddart","given":"Amina K."},{"family":"Gagnon","given":"Graham A."},{"family":"Dellaire","given":"Graham"}],"citation-key":"mathavarajah_etal21","container-title":"Science of The Total Environment","container-title-short":"Science of The Total Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143346","ISSN":"00489697","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","page":"143346","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Pandemic danger to the deep: The risk of marine mammals contracting SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater","title-short":"Pandemic danger to the deep","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0048969720368777","volume":"760"},

  {"id":"mcclain_etal15","abstract":"What are the greatest sizes that the largest marine megafauna obtain? This is a simple question with a difficult and complex answer. Many of the largest-sized species occur in the world’s oceans. For many of these, rarity, remoteness, and quite simply the logistics of measuring these giants has made obtaining accurate size measurements difficult. Inaccurate reports of maximum sizes run rampant through the scientific literature and popular media. Moreover, how intraspecific variation in the body sizes of these animals relates to sex, population structure, the environment, and interactions with humans remains underappreciated. Here, we review and analyze body size for 25 ocean giants ranging across the animal kingdom. For each taxon we document body size for the largest known marine species of several clades. We also analyze intraspecific variation and identify the largest known individuals for each species. Where data allows, we analyze spatial and temporal intraspecific size variation. We also provide allometric scaling equations between different size measurements as resources to other researchers. In some cases, the lack of data prevents us from fully examining these topics and instead we specifically highlight these deficiencies and the barriers that exist for data collection. Overall, we found considerable variability in intraspecific size distributions from strongly left- to strongly right-skewed. We provide several allometric equations that allow for estimation of total lengths and weights from more easily obtained measurements. In several cases, we also quantify considerable geographic variation and decreases in size likely attributed to humans.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"McClain","given":"Craig R."},{"family":"Balk","given":"Meghan A."},{"family":"Benfield","given":"Mark C."},{"family":"Branch","given":"Trevor A."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Cosgrove","given":"James"},{"family":"Dove","given":"Alistair D.M."},{"family":"Gaskins","given":"Lindsay C."},{"family":"Helm","given":"Rebecca R."},{"family":"Hochberg","given":"Frederick G."},{"family":"Lee","given":"Frank B."},{"family":"Marshall","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"McMurray","given":"Steven E."},{"family":"Schanche","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Stone","given":"Shane N."},{"family":"Thaler","given":"Andrew D."}],"citation-key":"mcclain_etal15","container-title":"PeerJ","DOI":"10.7717/peerj.715","ISSN":"2167-8359","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","page":"e715","source":"Crossref","title":"Sizing ocean giants: patterns of intraspecific size variation in marine megafauna","title-short":"Sizing ocean giants","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://peerj.com/articles/715","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"mcguire_bemis17","abstract":"Placing scent marks in the environment allows individuals to transfer information without direct interactions. Given that body size often indicates competitive ability, small individuals may preferentially communicate via scent marking because direct social interactions are potentially costly. However, most evidence indicates a positive relationship between competitive ability and frequency of scent marking. Domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) exhibit extreme morphological variation, which allowed us to examine whether scent-marking behavior varied with body size in shelter dogs. We observed 281 dogs on 20-min walks and recorded total urinations, urinations directed at targets in the environment, and defecations. Some dogs were walked once and others multiple times (total walks, 619). We found that size class inﬂuenced rate of urination (P = 0.002): small dogs urinated at higher rates (0.36 urinations per min) than both medium (0.26) and large dogs (0.24). There was a tendency for size class to inﬂuence percent of directed urinations (P = 0.057): small dogs directed more of their urinations at targets in the environment (72%) than did large dogs (60%). Consistent with previous reports, we found that males urinated at higher rates (0.41) than females (0.18; P < 0.0001), and directed more of their urinations (males, 87%; females, 45%; P < 0.0001). Body size and sex did not inﬂuence likelihood of defecation during a walk. Defecation is thought to play a less important role than urination in scent marking in dogs, so the absence of size and sex differences in likelihood of defecation was not surprising. Time spent at the shelter positively inﬂuenced rate of urination (P = 0.0005), percent of directed urinations (P = 0.005), and likelihood of defecation (P = 0.006), which we interpret as resulting from the dogs becoming increasingly familiar and more comfortable with us. Our ﬁndings regarding body size and urinary behavior support the hypothesis that small dogs communicate more frequently via scent marking than larger dogs. Body size is known to inﬂuence visual and auditory communication in mammals, and our data show that body size also inﬂuences chemical communication. Finally, our results provide context for problematic marking behaviors in the home.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,30]]},"author":[{"family":"McGuire","given":"Betty"},{"family":"Bemis","given":"Katherine E."}],"citation-key":"mcguire_bemis17","container-title":"Applied Animal Behaviour Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.applanim.2016.11.001","ISSN":"01681591","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","page":"49-55","source":"Crossref","title":"Scent marking in shelter dogs: Effects of body size","title-short":"Scent marking in shelter dogs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168159116303173","volume":"186"},
  {"id":"mcguire_etal12","abstract":"1. Some bat species make long-distance latitudinal migrations between summer and winter grounds, but because of their elusive nature, few aspects of their biology are well understood. The need for migratory stopover sites to rest and refuel, such as used by birds, has been repeatedly suggested, but not previously tested empirically in bats. 2. We studied migrating silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) at Long Point, ON, Canada. We used digital radio-transmitters to track 30 bats using an array of five towers that effectively covered the entire region (c. 20 × 40 km). We measured stopover duration and departure direction, and documented movement patterns, foraging activity and roost sites. We measured body composition on arrival using quantitative magnetic resonance and simulated long-distance migration using observed body composition to predict migration range and rate. 3. Migration occurred in two waves (late August and mid-September). Most bats stayed 1–2 days, although two remained >2 weeks. One third of the bats foraged while at the site, many foraging opportunistically on nights when rain precluded continued migration. Bats roosted in a variety of tree species and manmade structures in natural and developed areas. Half of the bats departed across Lake Erie (minimum crossing distance c. 38 km) while half departed along the shoreline. 4. Simulations predicted a migration rate of c. 250–275 km per day and suggest that all but one of the bats in our study carried sufficient fuel stores to reach the putative wintering area (estimated distance 1500 km) without further refuelling. 5. Our results suggest that migrating bats stopover for sanctuary or short-term rest as opposed to extended rest and refuelling as in many songbirds. Daily torpor could reduce energy costs when not in flight, minimizing the need for extended stopovers and allowing bats to potentially complete their migration at a fraction of the time and energy cost of similar sized birds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"McGuire","given":"Liam P."},{"family":"Guglielmo","given":"Christopher G."},{"family":"Mackenzie","given":"Stuart A."},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Philip D."}],"citation-key":"mcguire_etal12","container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01912.x","ISSN":"1365-2656","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2011 The Authors.

  {"id":"mcguire_etal18","abstract":"Scent marking is a common mode of communication in mammals. Such marking is thought to communicate information about the signaler’s size and corresponding competitive ability and accurately reﬂect the signaler’s attributes (i.e., an honest signal). However, new data suggest that scent marking can be dishonest in certain circumstances. Via two studies, we tested the hypothesis that urine marking is a dishonest signal in adult male domestic dogs, which raise a hindlimb when marking vertical objects. In Study 1, we tested whether raised-leg angle (i.e., during a urination, the angle between a dog’s raised leg and the axis normal to the ground) is a proxy for urine mark height (n = 15 dogs) and, in Study 2, we tested whether small dogs exhibit larger raised-leg angles than large dogs (n = 45 dogs). We videotaped urinations of adult male dogs and, afterwards, measured height of urine marks (Study 1) and degree of raised-leg angles (Studies 1 and 2). In Study 1, we found signiﬁcant positive relationships between both raised-leg angle and height of urine mark and body size (using either body mass or height at withers) and height of urine mark; raised-leg angle was a stronger predictor than either measure of body size. In Study 2, we found a signiﬁcant negative relationship between body size (using either body mass or height at withers) and average raised-leg angle. Our ﬁndings support raisedleg angle as a proxy for urine mark height and provide additional evidence that scent marking can be dishonest. Assuming body size is a proxy for competitive ability, small adult male dogs may place urine marks higher, relative to their own body size, than larger adult male dogs to exaggerate their competitive ability. We did not control for over marking, which also may explain our ﬁndings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,30]]},"author":[{"family":"McGuire","given":"B."},{"family":"Olsen","given":"B."},{"family":"Bemis","given":"K.

  {"id":"mcguire_gough17","abstract":"Motor laterality is the preferential use of structures on one side of the body. Although domestic dogs are commonly used in laterality research, few studies have examined hindlimb motor tasks, and no study, to our knowledge, has examined the effects of body size on measures of laterality. First, we observed 659 dogs during walks at 2 animal shelters to assess likelihood of raising a hindlimb during urination in relation to body size, age class (juvenile, adult, and senior), reproductive status (intact vs. spayed or neutered), shelter, and time spent at shelters; males and females were analyzed separately, and we excluded juveniles from statistical analyses because no female in this age class raised a hindlimb. Second, we observed a subset of the adult and senior dogs (n ¼ 46) over multiple walks to determine if they exhibited side preferences with respect to hindlimb raised during urination. We looked for individual biases and a population bias and analyzed hindlimb preferences with respect to body size. For both males and females, small dogs were more likely than medium and large dogs to raise a hindlimb during urination. Intact males (96%) were more likely than neutered males (83%) to have a predominant urinary posture with a raised hindlimb. Time spent at the shelters inﬂuenced urinary posture in mature males: with each additional day spent at the shelter, the odds of a male having a predominant urinary posture with a raised hindlimb increased by 2%. We found the following distribution of hindlimb preferences in the subset of dogs studied for laterality: right preferent, 19.6%; left preferent, 30.4%; and ambilateral, 50.0%. There was no evidence of a population-wide bias for hindlimb raised. Body size did not inﬂuence laterality strength or whether a dog was hindlimb preferent (right or left) versus ambilateral. Thus, the likelihood of raising a hindlimb when urinating, but not laterality with respect to hindlimb raised, can be added to the growing list of behavioral differences between small dogs and larger dogs. Previous studies have reported that under stressful conditions, mature male dogs may temporarily revert to the juvenile urinary posture in which no hindlimb is raised. Our ﬁnding for adult and senior males that likelihood of raising a hindlimb during urination increased with time spent at the shelters suggests that male urinary posture could potentially serve as a behavioral indicator of adjustment to shelter conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"McGuire","given":"Betty"},{"family":"Gough","given":"William"}],"citation-key":"mcguire_gough17","container-title":"Journal of Veterinary Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.jveb.2017.08.001","ISSN":"15587878","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","license":"All rights reserved","page":"38-44","source":"Crossref","title":"Body size influences urinary posture but not hindlimb laterality in shelter dogs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1558787817300783","volume":"21"},

I studied scent-marking behavior during single walks of 500 male and female dogs at two shelters (Tompkins County SPCA and Cortland Community SPCA). My sample included juveniles, adults, and seniors. I found a signiﬁcant effect of age on frequency of urination (P < 0.0001 at both shelters): seniors urinated more frequently than adults (contrast signiﬁcant at the Cortland shelter; P < 0.07 at the Tompkins shelter), which urinated more frequently than juveniles. Age also inﬂuenced likelihood of directing urinations at targets in the environment (P < 0.0001 at both shelters): seniors directed more of their urinations than did adults (signiﬁcant at Cortland shelter only), which directed more of their urinations than did juveniles. I found that males urinated more frequently than females (P < 0.0001 at both shelters) and directed more of their urinations (P < 0.0001 at both shelters). Signiﬁcant age and sex differences did not characterize defecation at either shelter. Ground scratching, whether after urination or defecation, was rarely performed by juveniles (% that ground scratched at least once: Tompkins shelter, <14%; Cortland shelter, 0%), so I excluded juveniles from analyses of this behavior. Ground scratching after urination was not associated with sex or age (adults versus seniors) at either shelter, but was positively associated with number of directed urinations (Tompkins shelter, P < 0.0001; Cortland shelter, P < 0.002). Ground scratching after defecation was not associated with sex at either shelter, but was associated with age at the Tompkins shelter (P < 0.03; % that ground scratched after at least one defecation: 28% of adults; 42% of seniors); a similar pattern occurred at the Cortland shelter (29% of adults; 50% of seniors), but the association failed to reach statistical signiﬁcance perhaps due to smaller sample sizes. Finally, at the Tompkins shelter, ground scratching after defecation was positively associated with number of urinations followed by ground scratching (P < 0.0001); here, again, a similar pattern occurred at the Cortland shelter but the association failed to reach statistical signiﬁcance.

Electronic communication and a virtual workshop were used to solicit and collate potential research questions from the marine mammal bioenergetic community. From a final list of 39 questions, 11 were identified as ‘key’ questions because they received votes from at least 50% of survey participants. Key questions included those related to energy intake (prey landscapes, exposure to human activities) and expenditure (field metabolic rate, exposure to human activities, lactation, time-activity budgets), energy allocation priorities, metrics of body condition and relationships with survival and reproductive success and extrapolation of data from one species to another. Existing tools to address key questions include labelled water, animal-borne sensors, mark-resight data from long-term research programs, environmental DNA and unmanned vehicles. Further validation of existing approaches and development of new methodologies are needed to comprehensively address some key questions, particularly for cetaceans.

  {"id":"mchuron_etal23","abstract":"Climate change and disturbance from human activities are key threats facing many wildlife populations worldwide. The ability to quantify the effects of such threats on individual health and population dynamics is critical for effective management and conservation. We used Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP), a method for implementing state-dependent life history theory, to explore the impacts of changes in prey availability and anthropogenic disturbance on survival and reproductive success of Cook Inlet belugas (Delphinapterus leucas, CIB), an endangered and isolated population in decline. We predicted behavioral decisions (whether to forage, travel to a new location, or rest) of pregnant CIBs within a spatially and seasonally dynamic prey landscape. We used those decisions to explore time-activity budgets and spatial use under a variety of hypothetical environmental scenarios and estimate the resulting impacts on body condition and vital rates. In all scenarios, foraging activity was highest during summer to capitalize on abundant prey, which in the model was assumed to be eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus) and salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.). This resulted in large increases in blubber reserves that pregnant CIBs relied on during October to April when prey was assumed to be less abundant. Prey availability outside of summer months was still critical, as it either exacerbated or buffered against reductions in prey availability during summer months. Spatial predictions of habitat use indicated that pregnant CIBs should forage in areas used historically that now appear to be abandoned, suggesting that prey availability alone is unlikely to explain the recent range contraction of CIBs to upper Cook Inlet. Reductions in prey availability from late spring to early fall adversely affected vital rates, but intermittent disturbances that resulted in lost foraging opportunities, such as those caused by anthropogenic activities during the ice-free season, had little impact on body condition or vital rates if prey were abundant during the summer and early fall. Accurate assessment of the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on CIBs requires robust data on both disturbances and year-round prey availability, as intermittent disturbances adversely affected survival and reproductive success when they occurred in environments with reduced prey availability. Our model represents an initial effort to fill a critical information gap for informing CIB management decisions, providing insights into conditions under which reductions in vital rates might be expected and highlighting key data needed to increase the applicability of the model to this endangered population.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,8]]},"author":[{"family":"McHuron","given":"Elizabeth A."},{"family":"Castellote","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Boor","given":"Himes"},{"family":"Shelden","given":"Kim E.

Such questions are increasingly important for marine mammals, as many populations are faced with rapidly changing and increasingly disturbed environments. Here we review the different energetic costs that marine mammals incur during gestation and lactation and how those costs are typically estimated in bioenergetic models. We compiled data availability on key model parameters for each species across all six marine mammal taxonomic groups (mysticetes, odontocetes, pinnipeds, sirenians, mustelids and ursids). Pinnipeds were the best-represented group regarding data availability, including estimates of milk intake, milk composition, lactation duration, birth mass, body composition at birth and growth. There were still considerable data gaps, particularly for polar species, and good data were only available across all parameters in 45% of pinniped species. Cetaceans and sirenians were comparatively data-poor, with some species having little or no data for any parameters, particularly beaked whales. Even for species with moderate data coverage, many parameter estimates were tentative or based on indirect approaches, necessitating reevaluation of these estimates. We discuss mechanisms and factors that affect maternal energy investment or prey requirements during reproduction, such as prey supplementation by offspring, metabolic compensation, environmental conditions and maternal characteristics. Filling the existing data gaps highlighted in this review, particularly for parameters that are influential on bioenergetic model outputs, will help refine reproductive costs estimated from bioenergetic models and better address how and when energy imbalances are likely to affect marine mammal populations.","author":[{"family":"McHuron","given":"Elizabeth A."},{"family":"Adamczak","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Costa","given":"Daniel P."},{"family":"Booth","given":"Cormac"}],"citation-key":"mchuron_etal23a","container-title":"Conservation Physiology","container-title-short":"Conserv Physiol","DOI":"10.1093/conphys/coac080","ISSN":"2051-1434","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023]]},"language":"eng","page":"coac080","PMCID":"PMC9845964","PMID":"36685328","source":"PubMed","title":"Estimating reproductive costs in marine mammal bioenergetic models: a review of current knowledge and data availability","title-short":"Estimating reproductive costs in marine mammal bioenergetic models","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"mcintyre14","abstract":"The number of scientific papers resulting from biologging instruments deployed on marine mammals is increasing as improved technologies result in smaller devices and improved sensor-, storage- and transmission capabilities. I undertook a comprehensive review of papers resulting from biologging deployments on free-ranging marine mammals between 1965 and 2013 (n = 620) to summarise where (e.g. on which species, as well as in which geographic areas) deployment efforts were focused, the impacts of the resulting papers, and where there are shortcomings in the literature. Species-, sex- and age-class biases were evident in terms of animals instrumented. Also, large proportions of the papers resulted from deployments on a small number of species (particularly among the pinnipeds) and were more often on adult females than other demographic classes. The mean impact of papers (as assessed using journal impact factors and numbers of citations) was consistent over time, and was influenced by the number of species studied, sample sizes and instrument capabilities. I found a paucity of papers addressing device influences on animals, as well as studies with explicit conservation and/or management implications. This review aims to increase awareness of marine mammal biologging data already collected, stimulate appropriate further studies, and encourage the reuse of existing data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"McIntyre","given":"T"}],"citation-key":"mcintyre14","container-title":"African Journal of Marine Science","DOI":"10.2989/1814232X.2014.976655","ISSN":"1814-232X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"page":"409-422","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Trends in tagging of marine mammals: a review of marine mammal biologging studies","title-short":"Trends in tagging of marine mammals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.2989/1814232X.2014.976655","volume":"36"},
  {"id":"mckenna_etal15","abstract":"Collisions between ships and whales are reported throughout the world’s oceans. For some endangered whale populations, ship strikes are a major threat to survival and recovery. Factors known to affect the incidence and severity of collisions include spatial co-occurrence of ships and whales, hydrodynamic forces around ships, and ship speed. Less understood and likely key to understanding differences in interactions between whales and ships is whale behavior in the presence of ships. In commercial shipping lanes off southern California, we simultaneously recorded blue whale behavior and commercial ship movement. A total of 20 ship passages with 9 individual whales were observed at distances ranging from 60 to 3600 m. We documented a dive response (i.e. shallow dive during surface period) of blue whales in the path of oncoming ships in 55% of the ship passages, but found no evidence for lateral avoidance. Descent rate, duration, and maximum depth of the observed response dives were similar to whale behavior immediately after suction-cup tag deployments. These behavioral data were combined with ship hydrodynamic forces to evaluate the maximum ship speed that would allow a whale time to avoid an oncoming ship. Our analysis suggests that the ability of blue whales to avoid ships is limited to relatively slow descents, with no horizontal movements away from a ship. We posit that this constrained response repertoire would limit their ability to adjust their response behavior to different ship speeds. This is likely a factor in making blue whales, and perhaps other large whales, more vulnerable to ship strikes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"McKenna","given":"Megan F."},{"family":"Calambokidis","given":"John"},{"family":"Oleson","given":"Erin M."},{"family":"Laist","given":"David W."},{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Jeremy A."}],"citation-key":"mckenna_etal15","container-title":"Endangered Species Research","DOI":"10.3354/esr00666","ISSN":"1863-5407, 1613-4796","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","page":"219-232","source":"www.int-res.com","title":"Simultaneous tracking of blue whales and large ships demonstrates limited behavioral responses for avoiding collision","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/esr/v27/n3/p219-232/","volume":"27"},

Given the primary importance of fatty acids for fueling intense exercise, we discuss the likely limiting steps in lipid transport and oxidation for exercising birds and the ecological factors that affect the quality and quantity of fat stored in wild birds. Most stored lipids in migratory birds are comprised of three fatty acids (16:0, 18:1 and 18:2) even though migratory birds have diverse food habits. Diet selection and selective metabolism of lipids play important roles in determining the fatty acid composition of birds which, in turn, affects energetic performance during intense exercise. As such, migratory birds offer an intriguing model for studying the implications of lipid metabolism and obesity on exercise performance. We conclude with a discussion of the energetic costs of migratory flight and stopover in birds, and its implications for bird migration strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"McWilliams","given":"Scott R."},{"family":"Guglielmo","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Pierce","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Klaassen","given":"Marcel"}],"citation-key":"mcwilliams_etal04","container-title":"Journal of Avian Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.0908-8857.2004.03378.x","ISSN":"1600-048X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"language":"en","page":"377-393","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Flying, fasting, and feeding in birds during migration: a nutritional and physiological ecology perspective","title-short":"Flying, fasting, and feeding in birds during migration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0908-8857.2004.03378.x","volume":"35"},
  {"id":"mehta_etal07","abstract":"Certain populations of killer whales Orcinus orca feed primarily or exclusively on marine mammals. However, whether or not baleen whales represent an important prey source for killer whales is debatable. A hypothesis by Springer et al. (2003) suggested that overexploitation of large whales by industrial whaling forced killer whales to prey-switch from baleen whales to pinnipeds and sea otters, resulting in population declines for these smaller marine mammals in the North Pacific and southern Bering Sea. This prey-switching hypothesis is in part contingent upon the idea that killer whales commonly attack mysticetes while they are in these high-latitude areas. In this study, we used photographic and sighting data from long-term studies of baleen whales in 24 regions worldwide to determine the proportion of whales that bear scars (rake marks) from killer whale attacks, and to examine the timing of scar acquisition. The results of this study show that there is considerable geographic variation in the proportion of whales with rake marks, ranging from 0% to >40% in different regions. In every region, the great majority of the scars seen were present on the whales’ bodies when the animals were first sighted. Less than 7% (9 of 132) of scarred humpback whales with multi-year sighting histories acquired new scars after the first sighting. This suggests that most killer whale attacks on baleen whales target young animals, probably calves on their first migration from low-latitude breeding and calving areas to high-latitude feeding grounds. Overall, our results imply that adult baleen whales are not an important prey source for killer whales in high latitudes, and therefore that one of the primary assumptions underlying the Springer et al. (2003) prey-switching hypothesis (and its purported link to industrial whaling) is invalid.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Mehta","given":"Amee V."},{"family":"Allen","given":"Judith M."},{"family":"Constantine","given":"Rochelle"},{"family":"Garrigue","given":"Claire"},{"family":"Jann","given":"Beatrice"},{"family":"Jenner","given":"Curt"},{"family":"Marx","given":"Marilyn K."},{"family":"Matkin","given":"Craig O."},{"family":"Mattila","given":"David K."},{"family":"Minton","given":"Gianna"},{"family":"Mizroch","given":"Sally A."},{"family":"Olavarría","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Robbins","given":"Jooke"},{"family":"Russell","given":"Kirsty G."},{"family":"Seton","given":"Rosemary E."},{"family":"Steiger","given":"Gretchen H."},{"family":"Víkingsson","given":"Gísli A."},{"family":"Wade","given":"Paul R."},{"family":"Witteveen","given":"Briana H."},{"family":"Clapham","given":"Phillip J."}],"citation-key":"mehta_etal07","container-title":"Marine Ecology Progress Series","DOI":"10.3354/meps07015","ISSN":"0171-8630, 1616-1599","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,10,25]]},"language":"en","page":"297-307","source":"www.int-res.com","title":"Baleen whales are not important as prey for killer whales Orcinus orca in high-latitude regions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v348/p297-307/","volume":"348"},
  {"id":"merkle_etal16","abstract":"The green wave hypothesis (GWH) states that migrating animals should track or ‘surf’ high-quality forage at the leading edge of spring green-up. To index such high-quality forage, recent work proposed the instantaneous rate of green-up (IRG), i.e. rate of change in the normalized difference vegetation index over time. Despite this important advancement, no study has tested the assumption that herbivores select habitat patches at peak IRG. We evaluated this assumption using step selection functions parametrized with movement data during the green-up period from two populations each of bighorn sheep, mule deer, elk, moose and bison, totalling 463 individuals monitored 1–3 years from 2004 to 2014. Accounting for variables that typically influence habitat selection for each species, we found seven of 10 populations selected patches exhibiting high IRG—supporting the GWH. Nonetheless, large herbivores selected for the leading edge, trailing edge and crest of the IRG wave, indicating that other mechanisms (e.g. ruminant physiology) or measurement error inherent with satellite data affect selection for IRG. Our evaluation indicates that IRG is a useful tool for linking herbivore movement with plant phenology, paving the way for significant advancements in understanding how animals track resource quality that varies both spatially and temporally.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Merkle","given":"Jerod A."},{"family":"Monteith","given":"Kevin L."},{"family":"Aikens","given":"Ellen O."},{"family":"Hayes","given":"Matthew M."},{"family":"Hersey","given":"Kent R."},{"family":"Middleton","given":"Arthur D."},{"family":"Oates","given":"Brendan A."},{"family":"Sawyer","given":"Hall"},{"family":"Scurlock","given":"Brandon M."},{"family":"Kauffman","given":"Matthew J."}],"citation-key":"merkle_etal16","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2016.0456","issue":"1833","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"page":"20160456","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Large herbivores surf waves of green-up during spring","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2016.0456","volume":"283"},

It is generally analysed by focusing on preferred speeds and gaits under particular biological and physical constraints. In the present paper we focus instead on the maximum speed and we study its order-of-magnitude scaling with body size, from bacteria to the largest terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Using data for about 460 species of various taxonomic groups, we find a maximum relative speed of the order of magnitude of ten body lengths per second over a 10 20-fold mass range of running and swimming animals. This result implies a locomotor time scale of the order of one tenth of second, virtually independent on body size, anatomy and locomotion style, whose ubiquity requires an explanation building on basic properties of motile organisms. From first-principle estimates, we relate this generic time scale to other basic biological properties, using in particular the recent generalisation of the muscle specific tension to molecular motors. Finally, we go a step further by relating this time scale to still more basic quantities, as environmental conditions at Earth in addition to fundamental physical and chemical constants.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Meyer-Vernet","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Rospars","given":"Jean-Pierre J.-P."}],"citation-key":"meyer-vernet_rospars16","container-title":"Physical Biology","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"source":"HAL Archives Ouvertes","title":"Maximum relative speeds of living organisms: why do bacteria perform as fast as ostriches?","title-short":"Maximum relative speeds of living organisms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01384319"},

Badgers frequently hunted hibernating squirrels in autumn, sometimes hunted infants in spring, and rarely hunted active squirrels in summer. Badgers always captured hibernating squirrels and infants underground, usually captured active squirrels underground, and sometimes intercepted fleeing squirrels aboveground. Regardless of season or year, the most common hunting technique used by badgers was excavation of burrow systems, but plugging of openings into ground-squirrel tunnels accounted for 5–23% of hunting actions in 4 consecutive years. Plugging occurred predominantly in mid-June to late July before most ground squirrels hibernated and in late August to late October when juvenile males were active but other squirrels were in hibernation. Badgers usually used soil from around the tunnel opening or soil dragged 30–270 cm from a nearby mound (72% and 22% of 391 plugged tunnels, respectively) to plug tunnels. The least common (6%), but most novel, form of plugging used by 1 badger involved movement of 37 objects from distances of 20–105 cm to plug openings into 23 ground-squirrel tunnels on 14 nights.

Sound, depth and orientation recording Dtags were attached to 23 whales in the Ligurian Sea and Gulf of Mexico to test whether the behaviour of diving sperm whales supports the hypothesis that creaks are produced during prey capture. Sperm whales spent most of their bottom time within one or two depth bands, apparently feeding in vertically stratified prey layers. Creak rates were highest during the bottom phase: 99.8% of creaks were produced in the deepest 50% of dives, 57% in the deepest 15% of dives. Whales swam actively during the bottom phase, producing a mean of 12.5 depth inflections per dive. A mean of 32% of creaks produced during the bottom phase occurred within 10 s of an inflection (13x more than chance). Sperm whales actively altered their body orientation throughout the bottom phase with significantly increased rates of change during creaks, reflecting increased manoeuvring. Sperm whales increased their bottom foraging time when creak rates were higher. These results all strongly support the hypothesis that creaks are an echolocation signal adapted for foraging, analogous to terminal buzzes in taxonomically diverse echolocating species.","author":[{"family":"Miller","given":"Patrick J.

The strength of these forces modulates the energetic cost of movement and may influence swimming style (gait). Here we use a high-resolution digital tag to record depth, 3-D orientation, and sounds heard and produced by 23 deep-diving sperm whales in the Ligurian Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Periods of active thrusting versus gliding were identified through analysis of oscillations measured by a 3-axis accelerometer. Accelerations during 382 ascent glides of five whales (which made two or more steep ascents and for which we obtained a measurement of length) were strongly affected by depth and speed at Reynold's numbers of 1.4–2.8×107. The accelerations fit a model of drag, air buoyancy and tissue buoyancy forces with an r 2 of 99.1–99.8% for each whale. The model provided estimates (mean ± s.d.) of the drag coefficient (0.00306±0.00015), air carried from the surface (26.4±3.9 l kg-3 mass), and tissue density (1030±0.8 kg m-3) of these five animals. The model predicts strong positive buoyancy forces in the top 100 m of the water column, decreasing to near neutral buoyancy at 250–850 m. Mean descent speeds (1.45±0.19 m s-1) were slower than ascent speeds (1.63±0.22 m s-1), even though sperm whales stroked steadily (glides 5.3±6.3%) throughout descents and employed predominantly stroke-and-glide swimming (glides 37.7±16.4%) during ascents. Whales glided more during portions of dives when buoyancy aided their movement, and whales that glided more during ascent glided less during descent (and vice versa ), supporting the hypothesis that buoyancy influences behavioural swimming decisions. One whale rested at∼ 10 m depth for more than 10 min without fluking, regulating its buoyancy by releasing air bubbles.","author":[{"family":"Miller","given":"Patrick J.

Here we use a high-resolution digital tag to record depth, 3-D orientation, and sounds heard and produced by 23 deep-diving sperm whales in the Ligurian Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Periods of active thrusting versus gliding were identified through analysis of oscillations measured by a 3-axis accelerometer. Accelerations during 382 ascent glides of five whales (which made two or more steep ascents and for which we obtained a measurement of length) were strongly affected by depth and speed at Reynold's numbers of 1.4–2.8×107. The accelerations fit a model of drag, air buoyancy and tissue buoyancy forces with an r2 of 99.1–99.8% for each whale. The model provided estimates (mean ± s.d.) of the drag coefficient(0.00306±0.00015), air carried from the surface (26.4±3.9 l kg-3 mass), and tissue density (1030±0.8 kg m-3)of these five animals. The model predicts strong positive buoyancy forces in the top 100 m of the water column, decreasing to near neutral buoyancy at 250–850 m. Mean descent speeds (1.45±0.19 m s-1) were slower than ascent speeds (1.63±0.22 m s-1), even though sperm whales stroked steadily (glides 5.3±6.3%) throughout descents and employed predominantly stroke-and-glide swimming (glides 37.7±16.4%)during ascents. Whales glided more during portions of dives when buoyancy aided their movement, and whales that glided more during ascent glided less during descent (and vice versa), supporting the hypothesis that buoyancy influences behavioural swimming decisions. One whale rested at∼10 m depth for more than 10 min without fluking, regulating its buoyancy by releasing air bubbles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Miller","given":"Patrick J.

  {"id":"miller_etal15","abstract":"Although northern bottlenose whales were the most heavily hunted beaked whale, we have little information about this species in its remote habitat of the North Atlantic Ocean. Underwater anthropogenic noise and disruption of their natural habitat may be major threats, given the sensitivity of other beaked whales to such noise disturbance. We attached dataloggers to 13 northern bottlenose whales and compared their natural sounds and movements to those of one individual exposed to escalating levels of 1–2kHz upsweep naval sonar signals. At a received sound pressure level (SPL) of 98dB re 1μPa, the whale turned to approach the sound source, but at a received SPL of 107dB re 1μPa, the whale began moving in an unusually straight course and then made a near 180° turn away from the source, and performed the longest and deepest dive (94min, 2339m) recorded for this species. Animal movement parameters differed significantly from baseline for more than 7h until the tag fell off 33–36km away. No clicks were emitted during the response period, indicating cessation of normal echolocation-based foraging. A sharp decline in both acoustic and visual detections of conspecifics after exposure suggests other whales in the area responded similarly. Though more data are needed, our results indicate high sensitivity of this species to acoustic disturbance, with consequent risk from marine industrialization and naval activity.","author":[{"family":"Miller","given":"Patrick J.

Substantial gaps remains in our knowledge of the turtle behaviour during the remaining inter-reproductive period, that spans over 2–3years. We report the results of a prolonged tracking experiment on loggerhead turtles nesting along the Ionian Calabria, the main breeding ground in Italy. Argos satellite transmitters were deployed on eight females, a sample representing a substantial fraction of the overall population (20–25 nesting females). All turtles but one were tracked for >300days (range: 313–1523days), revealing their spatial behaviour during a complete reproductive cycle and providing novel information on a number of poorly-known aspects of loggerhead spatial ecology: i) the post-nesting migratory strategy resulted in accordance with that of most adult loggerheads tracked so far, as the nine routes of six turtles were directed towards specific sites all located in the Tunisian continental shelf, a main foraging area for Mediterranean turtles; ii) the pre-breeding migratory routes were rather variable, likely deriving from different navigational strategies adopted by migrating turtles, and their temporal pattern indicates that mating occurred away from the nesting area; iii) the 10 inter-nesting movements of four turtles revealed unusual long-distance loops mostly in oceanic waters (median of maximum distance from nesting location: 145.5km); iv) while at the foraging grounds, four turtles occupied distinct areas during summer and winter, making directed movements between the two sites, seasonal core areas were separated and their size was larger in winter than in summer (median: 498km2 vs. 258km2); v) individual females displayed an high fidelity to both sites in successive years. These findings further highlight the plasticity in loggerhead spatial behaviour and the importance of the Central Mediterranean and of the Tunisian shelf for loggerhead conservation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Mingozzi","given":"Toni"},{"family":"Mencacci","given":"Resi"},{"family":"Cerritelli","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Giunchi","given":"Dimitri"},{"family":"Luschi","given":"Paolo"}],"citation-key":"mingozzi_etal16","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jembe.2016.08.007","ISSN":"0022-0981","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,1]]},"page":"8-17","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Living between widely separated areas: Long-term monitoring of Mediterranean loggerhead turtles sheds light on cryptic aspects of females spatial ecology","title-short":"Living between widely separated areas","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002209811630140X","volume":"485"},

Here, we provide detailed evidence of whale sharks interacting with schools of anchovy on four occasions in Bahia de Los Angeles, Baja California, Mexico. Three of these were predatory interactions in multi-species feeding frenzies, and one was a non-predatory interaction. In predatory interactions, whale sharks exhibited two types of feeding behaviors: (1) stationary suction-feeding, a previously described behavior for whale sharks, and (2) lunge-feeding, which has not been previously described in whale sharks, but has been observed among other large filter feeders, such as rorqual whales. The whale sharks moved simultaneously around the school of anchovy, lunging simultaneously or one after another into the school, with 66% (N = 17) of these lunges occurring in the same direction. In the non-predatory interaction, whale sharks exhibited “sit-and-wait\" behavior. The evidence presented here, along with previous observations, suggests that whale sharks may change their feeding strategy from suction to lunge-feeding when other predators corner schooling fish.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Montero-Quintana","given":"Austin N."},{"family":"Ocampo-Valdez","given":"Carlos F."},{"family":"Vázquez-Haikin","given":"J.

  {"id":"motta_etal10","abstract":"The feeding anatomy, behavior and diet of the whale shark Rhincodon typus were studied off Cabo Catoche, Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. The ﬁltering apparatus is composed of 20 unique ﬁltering pads that completely occlude the pharyngeal cavity. A reticulated mesh lies on the proximal surface of the pads, with openings averaging 1.2 mm in diameter. Superﬁcial to this, a series of primary and secondary cartilaginous vanes support the pads and direct the water across the primary gill ﬁlaments. During surface ram ﬁlter feeding, sharks swam at an average velocity of 1.1 m/s with 85% of the open mouth below the water’s surface. Sharks on average spent approximately 7.5 h/day feeding at the surface on dense plankton dominated by sergestids, calanoid copepods, chaetognaths and ﬁsh larvae. Based on calculated ﬂow speed and underwater mouth area, it was estimated that a whale shark of 443 cm total length (TL) ﬁlters 326 m3/h, and a 622 cm TL shark 614 m3/h. With an average plankton biomass of 4.5 g/m3 at the feeding site, the two sizes of sharks on average would ingest 1467 and 2763 g of plankton per hour, and their daily ration would be approximately 14,931 and 28,121 kJ, respectively. These values are consistent with independently derived feeding rations of captive, growing whale sharks in an aquarium. A feeding mechanism utilizing cross-ﬂow ﬁltration of plankton is described, allowing the sharks to ingest plankton that is smaller than the mesh while reducing clogging of the ﬁltering apparatus.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Motta","given":"Philip J."},{"family":"Maslanka","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Hueter","given":"Robert E."},{"family":"Davis","given":"Ray L."},{"family":"Parra","given":"Rafael","non-dropping-particle":"de la"},{"family":"Mulvany","given":"Samantha L."},{"family":"Habegger","given":"Maria Laura"},{"family":"Strother","given":"James A."},{"family":"Mara","given":"Kyle R."},{"family":"Gardiner","given":"Jayne M."},{"family":"Tyminski","given":"John P."},{"family":"Zeigler","given":"Leslie D."}],"citation-key":"motta_etal10","container-title":"Zoology","DOI":"10.1016/j.zool.2009.12.001","ISSN":"09442006","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","page":"199-212","source":"Crossref","title":"Feeding anatomy, filter-feeding rate, and diet of whale sharks Rhincodon typus during surface ram filter feeding off the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0944200610000486","volume":"113"},

  {"id":"narazaki_etal18","abstract":"Many baleen whales undertake annual fasting and feeding cycles, resulting in substantial changes in their body condition, an important factor affecting fitness. As a measure of lipid-store body condition, tissue density of a few deep diving marine mammals has been estimated using a hydrodynamic glide model of drag and buoyancy forces. Here, we applied the method to shallow-diving humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in North Atlantic and Antarctic feeding aggregations. High-resolution 3-axis acceleration, depth and speed data were collected from 24 whales. Measured values of acceleration during 5 s glides were fitted to a hydrodynamic glide model to estimate unknown parameters (tissue density, drag term and diving gas volume) in a Bayesian framework. Estimated species-average tissue density (1031.6 ± 2.1 kg m-3, ±95% credible interval) indicates that humpback whale tissue is typically negatively buoyant although there was a large inter-individual variation ranging from 1025.2 to 1043.1 kg m-3. The precision of the individual estimates was substantially finer than the variation across different individual whales, demonstrating a progressive decrease in tissue density throughout the feeding season and comparably high lipid-store in pregnant females. The drag term (CDAm-1) was estimated to be relatively high, indicating a large effect of lift-related induced drag for humpback whales. Our results show that tissue density of shallow diving baleen whales can be estimated using the hydrodynamic gliding model, although cross-validation with other techniques is an essential next step. This method for estimating body condition is likely to be broadly applicable across a range of aquatic animals and environments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Narazaki","given":"Tomoko"},{"family":"Isojunno","given":"Saana"},{"family":"Nowacek","given":"Douglas P."},{"family":"Swift","given":"Rene"},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari S."},{"family":"Ramp","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Smout","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Aoki","given":"Kagari"},{"family":"Deecke","given":"Volker B."},{"family":"Sato","given":"Katsufumi"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Patrick J.

The effect of fiber addition to concrete on some of the major parameters namely peak stress, strain at peak stress, the toughness of concrete and the nature of the stress±strain curve is studied. A simple analytical model is proposed to generate both the ascending and descending portions of the stress±strain curve. There exists a good correlation between the experimental results and those calculated based on the analytical model.

Because these observations were limited and generally viewed from afar, variability in respiratory properties was unknown and oxygen consumption estimates assumed constant breath-to-breath tidal volume and oxygen uptake. However, evidence suggests that cetaceans in human care vary tidal volume and breathing frequency to meet aerobic demand, which would significantly impact energetic estimates if the findings held in free-ranging species. In this study, we used suction cup-attached video tags positioned posterior to the nares of two humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and four Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) to measure inhalation duration, relative nares expansion, and maximum nares expansion. Inhalation duration and nares expansion varied between and within initial, middle, and terminal breaths of surface sequences between dives. The initial and middle breaths exhibited the least variability and had the shortest durations and smallest nares expansions. In contrast, terminal breaths were highly variable, with the longest inhalation durations and the largest nares expansions. Our results demonstrate breath-to-breath variability in duration and nares expansion, suggesting differential oxygen exchange in each breath during the surface interval. With future validation, inhalation duration or nares area could be used alongside respiratory frequency to improve oxygen consumption estimates by accounting for breath-to-breath variation in wild whales.","author":[{"family":"Nazario","given":"Emily C."},{"family":"Cade","given":"David E."},{"family":"Bierlich","given":"K.C."},{"family":"Czapanskiy","given":"Max F."},{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Jeremy A."},{"literal":"Shirel R.

However, no direct measures of seasonal foraging behaviour existed to corroborate this hypothesis. We attached high-resolution, motion-sensing biologging tags to 69 humpback whales along the Western Antarctic Peninsula throughout the feeding season from January to June to determine how foraging effort changes throughout the season. Our results did not support existing hypotheses: we found a significant reduction in foraging presence and feeding rates from the beginning to the end of the feeding season. During the early summer period, feeding occurred during all hours at high rates. As the season progressed, foraging occurred mostly at night and at lower rates.

To study the extent of physiological adaptations in migratory and resident blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus during the period of autumn migration in southern Sweden, we measured basal metabolic rate (BMR) and cost of thermoregulation at 0°C (CTR0). In contrast to other migrants en route, migratory blue tits had lower BMR than residents. As migratory blue tits travel extraordinarily slowly on autumn migration and residents suffer from harsher climate and severe competition, residents may need dynamic adjustments that involve larger metabolic costs than migrants. Resident males had lower CTR0 than migrants and resident females. Resident males are socially dominant, which suggests that they have priority of access to food sources during summer and early autumn. They also spend more time on moult, which would give them the time and energy needed for molting into a plumage of higher insulation quality than is possible for migrants and resident females.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Nilsson","given":"Anna L.

  {"id":"noad_cato07","abstract":"Limited data exist on swimming speeds of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and none on swimming speeds of singing whales during migration. We tracked humpback whales visually and acoustically during migration from the breeding grounds past our study site on the east coast of Australia (latitude 26°28′S). The mean swimming speed for whales while singing was 2.5 km/h, significantly less than for non-singing whales with a mean of 4.0 km/h but significantly greater than the mean of 1.6 km/h observed for singing whales on the Hawaiian breeding grounds. Between song sessions, there was no significant difference in speeds between whales that had been singing and other whales. Migration speeds were less for whales while singing but increased during the season. Although humpback whales can swim rapidly while singing (maximum observed 15.6 km/h), they generally do not do so, even during migration. Slower migration by singers would delay their return to the polar feeding areas and may be costly, but may be a strategy to provide access to more females.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Noad","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Cato","given":"Douglas H."}],"citation-key":"noad_cato07","container-title":"Marine Mammal Science","DOI":"10.1111/j.1748-7692.2007.02414.x","ISSN":"1748-7692","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"en","page":"481-495","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Swimming Speeds of Singing and Non-Singing Humpback Whales During Migration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1748-7692.2007.02414.x","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"norberg77","abstract":"(1) A deductive, theoretical model is developed to allow calculation of a minimum energy budget and the corresponding time budget for foraging, both based on a diel (24 h) cycle. The model refers to animals with relatively high energetic costs of foraging, such as birds and mammals. (2) Various contributions to the daily time budget for foraging of a predator are identified and expressed as functions of prey density. (3) The prolongation of the daily search time, due to the energy expenditure for foraging, is expressed as a function of the total daily search time and the ratio between the energy consumption of the foraging activities and basal metabolism. (4) Different search methods are characterized by the search efficiency and energy expenditure linked to them. It is argued that, in general, the efficiency of a search method increases with its energy consumption. Optimization of foraging behaviour is taken to mean minimization of the necessary daily foraging time. Two constraints prevail: (i) the animal must gather a certain minimum amount of energy per day, and (ii) it has a certain maximum time available for foraging per day. (5) Equations are devised to allow comparison of the profitability of different search methods at various prey densities (or daily search times). From these equations, and from graphs based on them, predictions can be made about optimal choice of search methods. (6) The most energy-consuming, but also most efficient, search methods should be employed by a predator at the highest prey densities. When prey density decreases a predator should shift to progressively less energy-consuming search methods although these are connected with low search efficiency. At food bottle-neck periods due to low density of available prey, predators thus should resort to their least energy-consuming search methods of low efficiency. (7) The length of time available for foraging per day does not affect the choice of optimal food-searching method, nor do increases in energy-consumption, due for instance to reproduction or temperature regulation in cold weather. (8) The smaller the predator and the bigger the prey, the more energy-consuming (and efficient) search methods the predator should employ.(9) Different patch selection for foraging probably often require different locomotion types. When similar foods are eaten, small species, rather than big ones, should exploit the habitat patches demanding the most energy-consuming search methods, at least when food is scarce. When food is depressed due to exploitation, interspecific competition should lead to this apportionment of patches and cause adaptations accordingly.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Norberg","given":"R.

  {"id":"noren_williams00","abstract":"Cetaceans exhibit an exceptionally wide range of body mass that inﬂuence both the capacities for oxygen storage and utilization; the balance of these factors is important for deﬁning dive limits. Furthermore, myoglobin content is a key oxygen store in the muscle as it is many times higher in marine mammals than terrestrial mammals. Yet little consideration has been given to the effects of myoglobin content or body mass on cetacean dive capacity. To determine the importance of myoglobin content and body mass on cetacean diving performance, we measured myoglobin content of the longissimus dorsi for ten odontocete (toothed whales) and one mysticete (baleen whales) species ranging in body mass from 70 to 80 000 kg. The results showed that myoglobin content in cetaceans ranged from 1.81 to 5.78 g (100 g wet muscle)−1. Myoglobin content and body mass were both positively and signiﬁcantly correlated to maximum dive duration in odontocetes; this differed from the relationship for mysticetes. Overall, the combined effects of body mass and myoglobin content accounts for 50% of the variation in cetacean diving performance. While independent analysis of the odontocetes showed that body mass and myoglobin content accounts for 83% of the variation in odontocete dive capacity. © 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

Studying the detailed behaviour of marine mammals involves challenges not faced by most animal behaviour researchers due to the size, mobility and lack of continuous visibility of these animals. We describe several methods developed by marine mammal scientists to study behaviour, primarily of cetaceans, focusing on technological advances: unmanned aerial systems (UAS), satellite-linked telemetry, passive acoustics and multisensor high-resolution acoustic recording tags. We then go on to explain how the data collected by these methods have contributed to and informed conservation actions. We focus on examples including: satellite data informing the interactions between cetaceans and offshore oil and gas development; passive acoustics used to track distributions of several species of cetaceans, including their movements near shipping lanes; and high-resolution acoustic recording tags used to document responses of cetaceans to anthropogenic activities. Finally, we discuss recent efforts to link animal behaviour to individual fitness and, particularly for behavioural disturbances, to population-level consequences, which can be helpful for informing conservation efforts. The infusion of technological advancements into studies of cetacean behaviour combined with emerging analytical techniques brings us to the next 20+ years of studying these animals. These developments will improve our capabilities in areas such as testing whether their behaviour adheres to traditional behavioural theory, and will certainly assist the guiding of conservation efforts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Nowacek","given":"Douglas P."},{"family":"Christiansen","given":"Fredrik"},{"family":"Bejder","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Jeremy A."},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari S."}],"citation-key":"nowacek_etal16","container-title":"Animal Behaviour","container-title-short":"Animal Behaviour","DOI":"10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.07.019","ISSN":"0003-3472","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"235-244","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Studying cetacean behaviour: new technological approaches and conservation applications","title-short":"Studying cetacean behaviour","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347216301452","volume":"120"},

  {"id":"oestreich_etal20","abstract":"Linking individual and population scales is fundamental to many concepts in ecology [1], including migration [2, 3]. This behavior is a critical [4] yet increasingly threatened [5] part of the life history of diverse organisms. Research on migratory behavior is constrained by observational scale [2], limiting ecological understanding and precise management of migratory populations in expansive, inaccessible marine ecosystems [6]. This knowledge gap is magnified for dispersed oceanic predators such as endangered blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus). As capital breeders, blue whales migrate vast distances annually between foraging and breeding grounds, and their population fitness depends on synchrony of migration with phenology of prey populations [7, 8]. Despite previous studies of individual-level blue whale vocal behavior via bio-logging [9, 10] and population-level acoustic presence via passive acoustic monitoring [11], detection of the life history transition from foraging to migration remains challenging. Here, we integrate direct high-resolution measures of individual behavior and continuous broad-scale acoustic monitoring of regional song production (Figure 1A) to identify an acoustic signature of the transition from foraging to migration in the Northeast Pacific population. We find that foraging blue whales sing primarily at night, whereas migratory whales sing primarily during the day. The ability to acoustically detect population-level transitions in behavior provides a tool to more comprehensively study the life history, fitness, and plasticity of population behavior in a dispersed, capital breeding population. Real-time detection of this behavioral signal can also inform dynamic management efforts [12] to mitigate anthropogenic threats to this endangered population [13, 14]).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Oestreich","given":"William K."},{"family":"Fahlbusch","given":"James A."},{"family":"Cade","given":"David E."},{"family":"Calambokidis","given":"John"},{"family":"Margolina","given":"Tetyana"},{"family":"Joseph","given":"John"},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari S."},{"family":"McKenna","given":"Megan F."},{"family":"Stimpert","given":"Alison K."},{"family":"Southall","given":"Brandon L."},{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Jeremy A."},{"family":"Ryan","given":"John P."}],"citation-key":"oestreich_etal20","container-title":"Current Biology","container-title-short":"Current Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.cub.2020.08.105","ISSN":"0960-9822","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","page":"4773-4779.e3","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Animal-Borne Metrics Enable Acoustic Detection of Blue Whale Migration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982220313312","volume":"30"},
  {"id":"oestreich_etal22","abstract":"Matching the timing of life-history transitions with ecosystem phenology is critical for the survival of many species, especially those undertaking long-distance migrations. As a result, whether and how migratory populations adjust timing of life-history transitions in response to environmental variability are important questions in ecology and conservation. Yet the flexibility and drivers of life-history transitions remain largely untested for migratory marine populations, which contend with the unique spatiotemporal dynamics and sensory conditions found in marine ecosystems. Here, using an acoustic signature of blue whales’ regional population-level transition from foraging to breeding migration, we document significant interannual flexibility in the timing of this life-history transition (spanning roughly 4 months) over a continuous 6-year study period. We further show that variability in the timing of this transition follows the oceanographic phenology of blue whales’ foraging habitat, with a later transition from foraging to breeding migration occurring in years with an earlier onset, later peak and greater accumulation of biological productivity. These findings indicate that blue whales delay the transition from foraging to southward migration in years of the highest and most persistent biological productivity, consistent with the hypothesis that this population maximizes energy intake on foraging grounds rather than departing towards breeding grounds as soon as sufficient energy reserves are accumulated. The use of flexible cues (e.g. foraging conditions and long-distance acoustic signals) in timing a major life-history transition may be key to the persistence of this endangered population facing the pressures of rapid environmental change. Furthermore, these results extend theoretical understanding of the flexibility and drivers of population-level migration to a relatively solitary marine migrant.

  {"id":"oftedal_etal14","abstract":"Mammalian milks may differ greatly in composition from cow milk, and these differences may affect the performance of analytical methods. High-fat, high-protein milks with a preponderance of oligosaccharides, such as those produced by many marine mammals, present a particular challenge. We compared the performance of several methods against reference procedures using Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii) milk of highly varied composition (by reference methods: 27–63% water, 24–62% fat, 8–12% crude protein, 0.5–1.8% sugar). A microdrying step preparatory to carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen (CHN) gas analysis slightly underestimated water content and had a higher repeatability relative standard deviation (RSDr) than did reference oven drying at 100°C. Compared with a reference macro-Kjeldahl protein procedure, the CHN (or Dumas) combustion method had a somewhat higher RSDr (1.56 vs. 0.60%) but correlation between methods was high (0.992), means were not different (CHN: 17.2±0.46% dry matter basis; Kjeldahl 17.3±0.49% dry matter basis), there were no significant proportional or constant errors, and predictive performance was high. A carbon stoichiometric procedure based on CHN analysis failed to adequately predict fat (reference: Röse-Gottlieb method) or total sugar (reference: phenol-sulfuric acid method). Gross energy content, calculated from energetic factors and results from reference methods for fat, protein, and total sugar, accurately predicted gross energy as measured by bomb calorimetry. We conclude that the CHN (Dumas) combustion method and calculation of gross energy are acceptable analytical approaches for marine mammal milk, but fat and sugar require separate analysis by appropriate analytic methods and cannot be adequately estimated by carbon stoichiometry. Some other alternative methods—low-temperature drying for water determination; Bradford, Lowry, and biuret methods for protein; the Folch and the Bligh and Dyer methods for fat; and enzymatic and reducing sugar methods for total sugar—appear likely to produce substantial error in marine mammal milks. It is important that alternative analytical methods be properly validated against a reference method before being used, especially for mammalian milks that differ greatly from cow milk in analyte characteristics and concentrations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Oftedal","given":"O.

The rate of milk energy transfer must be very high to ensure that pups are weaned with sufficient energy reserves to withstand the lengthy postweaning fast. Milk energy transfer was measured by isotope dilution (n = 6), and energy deposition was assayed by chemical analysis of pups at birth (n = 4) and weaning (n = 5). Estimates of body water content obtained by isotope dilution and direct analysis were not significantly different. Water constituted only 71.7% ± 0.50% (SE) of lean body mass at birth, indicating developmental maturity. Newborn pups were also high in fat (14.0% ± 0.78%) and energy (10.1 ± 0.25 MJ/kg). Pups consumed 7.52 ± 0.469 kg/d milk containing 187 ± 11.6 MJ/d. Total milk and energy yields were estimated as 30.1 kg and 746 MJ. Pups deposited 88% of ingested fat, 41% of protein, and 84% of energy. Of the weight gain, 82% was fat. The energy content of pups increased nearly fourfold from birth to weaning, but protein content increased by only 11%. At weaning, the energy content of the pup was similar, relative to maternal metabolic size ($17. 7 MJ/kg^{0.75}$), to that in other species with longer lactation periods. We conclude that extreme abbreviation of lactation is feasible as a reproductive strategy in the hooded seal because (1) most of the growth of the lean body and 27% of the energy deposition in pups occur in utero, (2) females produce large amounts of high-fat milk, and (3) the pups are very eficient at converting milk fat to stored lipids.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Oftedal","given":"Olav T."},{"family":"Bowen","given":"W.

  {"id":"oftedal00","abstract":"The substrate demands of lactation must be met by increased dietary intake or by mobilization of nutrients from tissues. The capacity of animals to rely on stored nutrients depends to a large extent on body size; large animals have greater stores, relative to the demands of lactation, than do small animals. The substrate demands of lactation depend on the composition and amount of milk produced. Animals that fast or feed little during lactation are expected to produce milks low in sugar but high in fat, in order to minimize needs for gluconeogenesis while sustaining energy transfers to the young. The patterns of nutrient transfer are reviewed for four taxonomic groups that fast during part of or throughout lactation: sea lions and fur seals (Carnivora: Otariidae), bears (Carnivora: Ursidae), true seals (Carnivora: Phocidae) and baleen whales (Cetacea: Mysticeti). All these groups produce low-sugar high-fat milks, although the length of lactation, rate of milk production and growth of the young are variable. Milk protein concentrations also tend to be low, if considered in relation to milk energy content. Maternal reserves are heavily exploited for milk production in these taxa. The amounts of lipid transferred to the young represent about one-fifth to one-third of maternal lipid stores; the relative amount of the gross energy of the body transferred in the milk is similar. Some seals and bears also transfer up to 16–18 % of the maternal body protein via milk. Reliance on maternal reserves has allowed some large mammals to give birth and lactate at sites and times far removed from food resources.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Oftedal","given":"Olav T."}],"citation-key":"oftedal00","container-title":"Proceedings of the Nutrition Society","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"oftedal97a","abstract":"Although it has been more than one hundred years since the first publication on the milks of whales and dolphins (Order Cetacea), information on lactation in these species is scattered and fragmentary. Yet the immense size of some cetaceans, and the recent evidence that another group of marine mammals, the true seals, have remarkable rates of secretion of milk fat and energy, make this group of great comparative interest. In this paper information on lactation patterns, milk composition and lactation performance is reviewed. Two very different patterns are evident. Many of the baleen whales (Suborder Mysticeti) have relatively brief lactations (5–7 months) during which they fast or eat relatively little. At mid-lactation they produce milks relatively low in water (40–53%), high in fat (30–50%), and moderately high in protein (9–15%) and ash (1.2–2.1%). From mammary gland weights and postnatal growth rates, it is predicted that their energy outputs in milk are exceptional, reaching on the order of 4000 MJ/d in the blue whale. This is possible because pregnant females migrate to feeding grounds where they can ingest and deposit great amounts of energy, building up blubber stores prior to parturition. On the other hand, the toothed whales and dolphins (Suborder Odontoceti) have much more extensive lactations typically lasting 1–3 years, during which the mothers feed. At mid-lactation their milks appear to be higher in water (60–77%) and lower in fat (10–30%) and ash (0.6–1.1%), with similar levels of protein (8–11%). At least some odontocetes resemble primates in terms of low predicted rates of energy output and a long period of dependency of the young. However, these hypotheses are based on small numbers of samples for a relatively small number of species. Much of the available data on milk composition is of rather poor quality; for example, it is not possible to determine if milk composition changes over the course of lactation among odontocetes. Additional research on cetacean mammary glands and their secretions is needed to understand the reproductive strategies of these fascinating animals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Oftedal","given":"Olav T."}],"citation-key":"oftedal97a","container-title":"Journal of Mammary Gland Biology and Neoplasia","container-title-short":"J Mammary Gland Biol Neoplasia","DOI":"10.1023/A:1026328203526","ISSN":"1573-7039","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1997,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"205-230","source":"Springer Link","title":"Lactation in Whales and Dolphins: Evidence of Divergence Between Baleen- and Toothed-Species","title-short":"Lactation in Whales and Dolphins","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1026328203526","volume":"2"},

To unravel the origins of such complex behaviors, it is crucial to investigate tool use that is not necessary for a species’ survival. These cases can be assumed to have emerged innovatively and be applied flexibly, thus emphasizing creativity and intelligence. However, it is intrinsically challenging to record tool innovations in natural settings that do not occur species-wide. Here, we report the discovery of two distinct tool manufacture methods and the use of tool sets in wild Goffin’s cockatoos (Cacatua goffiniana). Up to three types of wooden tools, differing in their physical properties and each serving a different function, were manufactured and employed to extract embedded seed matter of Cerbera manghas. While Goffin’s cockatoos do not depend on tool-obtained resources, repeated observations of two temporarily captive wild birds and indications from free-ranging individuals suggest this behavior occurs in the wild, albeit not species-wide. The use of a tool set in a non-primate implies convergent evolution of advanced tool use. Furthermore, these observations demonstrate how a species without hands can achieve dexterity in a high-precision task. The presence of flexible use and manufacture of tool sets in animals distantly related to humans significantly diversifies the phylogenetic landscape of technology and opens multiple avenues for future research.\nVideo abstract","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"O’Hara","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Mioduszewska","given":"Berenika"},{"family":"Mundry","given":"Roger"},{"literal":"Yohanna"},{"family":"Haryoko","given":"Tri"},{"family":"Rachmatika","given":"Rini"},{"family":"Prawiradilaga","given":"Dewi M."},{"family":"Huber","given":"Ludwig"},{"family":"Auersperg","given":"Alice M.

  {"id":"okie_etal13","abstract":"Body size affects nearly all aspects of organismal biology, so it is important to understand the constraints and dynamics of body size evolution. Despite empirical work on the macroevolution and macroecology of minimum and maximum size, there is little general quantitative theory on rates and limits of body size evolution. We present a general theory that integrates individual productivity, the lifestyle component of the slow–fast life-history continuum, and the allometric scaling of generation time to predict a clade's evolutionary rate and asymptotic maximum body size, and the shape of macroevolutionary trajectories during diversifying phases of size evolution. We evaluate this theory using data on the evolution of clade maximum body sizes in mammals during the Cenozoic.

  {"id":"okie_etal13a","abstract":"Body size affects nearly all aspects of organismal biology, so it is important to understand the constraints and dynamics of body size evolution. Despite empirical work on the macroevolution and macroecology of minimum and maximum size, there is little general quantitative theory on rates and limits of body size evolution. We present a general theory that integrates individual productivity, the lifestyle component of the slow–fast life-history continuum, and the allometric scaling of generation time to predict a clade's evolutionary rate and asymptotic maximum body size, and the shape of macroevolutionary trajectories during diversifying phases of size evolution. We evaluate this theory using data on the evolution of clade maximum body sizes in mammals during the Cenozoic.

Many rorqual whale species lunge feed at the surface, yet existing methodologies for detecting lunges in accelerometer data have not been applied to surface-feeding behavior. Our study aimed to develop a method to detect surface-feeding behavior in accelerometer data and in doing so, determine whether wave drag influences the detection of surface-feeding behavior. A new acceleration parameter is described that considers the forward acceleration of the animal relative to its pitch. The new parameter, along with information on the deceleration and pitch angle, was then used in an automatic lunge detecting algorithm followed by a visual classification method that detected approximately 70% of the lunges observed during focal follow sampling. The forward acceleration of lunges decreased significantly with increasing proximity to the surface. This lower acceleration at the surface may influence the ability to detect lunge feeding behavior close to the surface. Future research should attempt to determine the cause of this relationship, which may be the influence of changes in the forces acting on the whale or behavioral flexibility by the whale.","author":[{"family":"Owen","given":"Kylie"},{"family":"Dunlop","given":"Rebecca A."},{"family":"Monty","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Chung","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Noad","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Donnelly","given":"David"},{"family":"Goldizen","given":"Anne W."},{"family":"Mackenzie","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"owen_etal16","container-title":"Marine Mammal Science","DOI":"10.1111/mms.12271","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 1905499514","page":"327-348","title":"Detecting surface‐feeding behavior by rorqual whales in accelerometer data","type":"article-journal","volume":"32"},
  {"id":"owen_etal17","abstract":"The humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) makes annual migrations from Antarctic feeding grounds to tropical breeding grounds. The extent to which it feeds during migration is unknown, but thought to be very low. Whether an animal feeds during migration is likely dependent on prey availability and on the ease with which it can capture the available prey. This study used digital tags (DTAGs) and concurrent prey sampling to measure how changes in the depth and type of prey influenced the lunge feeding rates and the amount of energy consumed by migrating humpback whales. Whales targeting krill lunged at significantly higher rates than whales targeting fish; however, the depth of the prey did not influence lunge rate. The observed lunge rates when feeding on krill, to the best of our knowledge, are higher than any previously reported rates of whales feeding. Estimates of the energetic content of the prey ingested revealed that whales may consume between 1.2 and 3.4 times their daily energy requirements per day while feeding on krill during migration, but less when feeding on fish. This suggests that whales may begin to restock energy supplies prior to reaching the Antarctic. Determining how often this high rate of energy intake occurs along the migratory route will assist with understanding the contribution of migratory energy intake to annual energy budgets.","author":[{"family":"Owen","given":"Kylie"},{"family":"Kavanagh","given":"Ailbhe S."},{"family":"Warren","given":"Joseph D."},{"family":"Noad","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Donnelly","given":"David"},{"family":"Goldizen","given":"Anne W."},{"family":"Dunlop","given":"Rebecca A."}],"citation-key":"owen_etal17","container-title":"Polar Biology","DOI":"10.1007/s00300-016-1951-9","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,2,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2344832907","page":"277-289","title":"Potential energy gain by whales outside of the Antarctic: prey preferences and consumption rates of migrating humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae)","type":"article-journal","volume":"40"},

  {"id":"pack_etal17","abstract":"We investigated whether calf age and calf size influence habitat choice by humpback whale mother–calf pairs in their breeding grounds. During 1997–2008, we conducted focal follows of mother–calf pairs in Hawaiian waters. Tail-fluke identification photographs and calf lengths (measured through videogrammetry) were obtained. Water depth and sea-bed terrain type were derived from GPS data. Identification photographs were matched so that the habitat choices could be established within breeding seasons. Across 72 mother–calf pairs resighted over various intervals within a breeding season, magnitude of depth change between initial and final sightings increased significantly with resighting interval. There was a significant increase from initial depth to final depth for relatively long resighting intervals (27–51 days), but no significant difference for relatively short resighting intervals (2–26 days). Although there was no preference for sea-bed terrain type by mother–calf pairs at their initial sighting, there was a preference for rugged terrain at their final resighting. A resource selection model indicated that the relative probability of a location being used by a mother–calf pair increased (as a function of water depth and rugged sea-bed terrain type) from initial to final sighting; a finding supported by subsequent tests of habitat preference versus availability. For 96 measured calves, calf length and water depth were positively correlated, even when ordinal day of measurement was controlled for statistically; a finding confirmed by a general linear model that simultaneously investigated the relationship between water depth, sea-bed terrain type, number of escorts, ordinal day and calf size. Thus, both calf age and size influence habitat choice by mother–calf pairs in their breeding grounds. The movement of mothers and their maturing calves into deeper waters where they favour rugged sea-bed terrain appears to be part of a suite of behavioural changes during the pre-migratory phase of residency in the breeding grounds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Pack","given":"Adam A."},{"family":"Herman","given":"Louis M."},{"family":"Craig","given":"Alison S."},{"family":"Spitz","given":"Scott S."},{"family":"Waterman","given":"James O."},{"family":"Herman","given":"Elia Y.

  {"id":"paig-tran_etal11","abstract":"We created physical models based on the morphology of ram suspension-feeding fishes to better understand the roles morphology and swimming speed play in particle retention, size selectivity and filtration efficiency during feeding events. We varied the buccal length, flow speed and architecture of the gills slits, including the number, size, orientation and pore size/permeability, in our models. Models were placed in a recirculating flow tank with slightly negatively buoyant plankton-like particles (~20–2000m) collected at the simulated esophagus and gill rakers to locate the highest density of particle accumulation. Particles were captured through sieve filtration, direct interception and inertial impaction. Changing the number of gill slits resulted in a change in the filtration mechanism of particles from a bimodal filter, with very small (≤50m) and very large (>1000m) particles collected, to a filter that captured medium-sized particles (101–1000m). The number of particles collected on the gill rakers increased with flow speed and skewed the size distribution towards smaller particles (51–500m). Small pore sizes (105 and 200m mesh size) had the highest filtration efficiencies, presumably because sieve filtration played a significant role. We used our model to make predictions about the filtering capacity and efficiency of neonatal whale sharks. These results suggest that the filtration mechanics of suspension feeding are closely linked to an animal’s swimming speed and the structural design of the buccal cavity and gill slits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Paig-Tran","given":"E.

  {"id":"paig-tran_etal13","abstract":"Three lineages of cartilaginous ﬁshes have independently evolved ﬁlter feeding (Lamniformes: Megachasma and Cetorhinus, Orectolobiformes: Rhincodon, and Mobulidae: Manta and Mobula); and the structure of the branchial ﬁlters is different in each group. The ﬁlter in Rhincodon typus has been described; species within the Lamniformes have simple ﬁlamentous ﬁlters, but the anatomy and ultrastructure of the branchial ﬁlter in the mobulid rays varies and is of functional interest. In most ﬁshes, branchial gill rakers are elongated structures located along the anterior ceratobranchial and/or epibranchial arches; however, mobulid gill rakers are highly modiﬁed, ﬂattened, lobe-like structures located on the anterior and posterior epibranchial elements as well as the ceratobranchials. The ultrastructure of the ﬁlter lobes can be smooth or covered by a layer of microcilia, and some are denticulated along the dorsal and ventral lobe surface. Flow through the mobulid oropharyngeal cavity differs from other ﬁlter-feeding ﬁshes in that water must rapidly deviate from the free stream direction. There is an abrupt 90  turn from the initial inﬂowing path to move through the laterally directed branchial ﬁlter pores, over the gill tissue, and out the ventrally located gill slits. The deviation in the ﬂow must result in tangential shearing stress across the ﬁlter surface. This implies that mobulids can use cross-ﬂow ﬁltration in which this shearing force serves as a mechanism to resuspend food particles initially caught by sieving or another capture mode. These particles will be transported by the cross ﬁlter ﬂow toward the esophagus. We propose that species with cilia on the rakers augment the shear mediated movement of particles along the ﬁlter with ciliary transport. J. Morphol. 274:10261043, 2013.

  {"id":"paig-tran_summers14","abstract":"The four, evolutionarily independent, lineages of suspension feeding elasmobranchs have two types of branchial filters. The first is a robust, flattened filter pad akin to a colander (e.g., whale sharks, mantas and devil rays) while the second more closely resembles the comb-like gill raker structure found in bony fishes (e.g., basking and megamouth sharks). The structure and the presence of mucus on the filter elements will determine the mechanical function of the filter and subsequent particle transport. Using histology and scanning electron microscopy, we investigated the anatomy of the branchial filters in 12 of the 14 species of Chondrichthyian filter-feeding fishes. We hypothesized that mucus producing cells would be abundant along the filter epithelium and perform as a sticky mechanism to retain and transport particles; however, we found that only three species had mucus producing goblet cells. Two of these (Mobula kuhlii and Mobula tarapacana) also had branchial cilia, indicating sticky retention and transport. The remaining filter-feeding elasmobranchs did not have a sticky surface along the filter for particles to collect and instead must employ alternative mechanisms of filtration (e.g., direct sieving, inertial impaction or cross-flow). With the exception of basking sharks, the branchial filter is composed of a hyaline cartilage skeleton surrounded by a layer of highly organized connective tissue that may function as a support. Megamouth sharks and most of the mobulid rays have denticles along the surface of the filter, presumably to protect against damage from large particle impactions. Basking sharks have branchial filters that lack a cartilaginous core; instead they are composed entirely of smooth keratin. Anat Rec, 297:701–715, 2014.

  {"id":"palacios_etal22","abstract":"Abstract Despite spending most time underwater, the technology in use to track whales over large geographic ranges via satellite has been largely limited to locational data, with most applications focusing on characterizing their horizontal movements. We describe the development of the RDW tag, a new Argos-based satellite telemetry device that incorporates sensors for monitoring the movements and dive behavior of large whales over several months without requiring recovery. Based on an implantable design, the tag features a saltwater conductivity switch, a tri-axial accelerometer, and an optional pressure transducer, along with onboard software for data processing and detection of behavioral events or activities of interest for transmission. We configured the software to detect dives and create per-dive summaries describing behavioral events associated with feeding activities in rorqual whales. We conducted a validation by proxy of the dive summary and event detection algorithms using field data from a medium-duration archival tag. We also conducted a simulation exercise to examine how the expected data recovery would vary under different dive behavior scenarios and compared those results to empirical values from field deployments of the RDW tag on blue ( Balaenoptera musculus ) and humpback ( Megaptera novaeangliae ) whales. The dive summary algorithm accurately reported dive depth and duration, while the accuracy of the lunge-feeding event detection algorithm was dependent on the precision of the accelerometer data that was used, with a predicted accuracy of 0.74 for correctly classifying feeding dives from 1/64-G precision data and 0.95 from 1-mG precision data. Simulated data recovery was lower with sparser transmission schedules, shorter mean dive durations, and lower rates of successfully received transmissions. Empirical data recovery was lower than expected from the simulation, suggesting the effect of additional factors, such as data gaps. By measuring key aspects of the per-dive behavior of large whales over multi-month timescales of movement, the RDW tags provide the ability to monitor previously unobservable behaviors across entire geographic ranges, extending the applications of satellite telemetry devices to new areas of whale physiology, behavior, ecology, and conservation.","author":[{"family":"Palacios","given":"Daniel M."},{"literal":"Ladd M.

Recent studies show evidence of social learning in the transmission of specific population level traits ranging from complex singing to stereotyped prey capturing behaviour. Humpback whales have been observed to employ group foraging techniques, however details on how individuals coordinate behaviour in these groups is challenging to obtain. This study investigates the role of a novel broadband patterned pulsed sound produced by humpback whales engaged in bottom-feeding behaviours, referred to here as a ‘paired burst’ sound. Data collected from 56 archival acoustic tag deployments were investigated to determine the functional significance of these signals. Paired burst sound production was associated exclusively with bottom feeding under low-light conditions, predominantly with evidence of associated conspecifics nearby suggesting that the sound likely serves either as a communicative signal to conspecifics, a signal to affect prey behaviour, or possibly both. This study provides additional evidence for individual variation and phenotypic plasticity of foraging behaviours in humpback whales and provides important evidence for the use of acoustic signals among foraging individuals in this species.","author":[{"family":"Parks","given":"Susan E."},{"family":"Cusano","given":"Dana A."},{"family":"Stimpert","given":"Alison K."},{"family":"Weinrich","given":"Mason T."},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari S."},{"family":"Wiley","given":"David N."}],"citation-key":"parks_etal15","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/srep07508","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,5,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2028461414","page":"7508-7508","PMCID":"4267198","PMID":"25512188","title":"Evidence for acoustic communication among bottom foraging humpback whales","type":"article-journal","volume":"4"},

An 8 kg individual would travel 830 km in 23 d. Although the bonnethead shark is a continuously active species, its routine metabolic rate and the efficiency of its locomotory system may be similar to that of \"typical\" bony fishes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Parsons","given":"G.

However, this requires quantitative information on their spatial and temporal presence, which is limited in the high seas. Here, we aimed to gain insights of the essential habitats of three baleen whale species around the mid-North Atlantic (NA) region, linking their large-scale movements with information on oceanographic and biological processes. Location Mid-NA Ocean. Methods We present the first study combining data from 31 satellite tracks of baleen whales (15, 10 and 6 from fin, blue and sei whales, respectively) from March to July (2008–2016) with data on remotely sensed oceanography and mid- and lower trophic level biomass derived from the spatial ecosystem and population dynamics model (SEAPODYM). A Bayesian switching state-space model was applied to obtain regular tracks and correct for location errors, and pseudo-absences were created through simulated positions using a correlated random walk model. Based on the tracks and pseudo-absences, we applied generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) to determine the probability of occurrence and predict monthly distributions. Results This study provides the most detailed research on the spatio-temporal distribution of baleen whales in the mid-NA, showing how dynamic biophysical processes determine their habitat preference. Movement patterns were mainly influenced by the interaction of temperature and the lower trophic level biomass; however, this relationship differed substantially among species. Best-fit models suggest that movements of whales migrating towards more productive areas in northern latitudes were constrained by depth and eddy kinetic energy. Main conclusions These novel insights highlight the importance of integrating telemetry data with spatially explicit prey models to understand which factors shape the movement patterns of highly migratory species across large geographical scales. In addition, our outcomes could contribute to inform management of anthropogenic threats to baleen whales in sparsely surveyed region.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Pérez-Jorge","given":"Sergi"},{"family":"Tobeña","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Prieto","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Vandeperre","given":"Frederic"},{"family":"Calmettes","given":"Beatriz"},{"family":"Lehodey","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Silva","given":"Mónica A."}],"citation-key":"perez-jorge_etal20","container-title":"Diversity and Distributions","DOI":"10.1111/ddi.13038","ISSN":"1472-4642","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","page":"683-698","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Environmental drivers of large-scale movements of baleen whales in the mid-North Atlantic Ocean","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ddi.13038","volume":"26"},
  {"id":"perryman_lynn02","abstract":"Vertical aerial photographs were collected of gray whales migrating along the California Coast between 1994 and 1998 to readdress some published findings on the biology and life history of this population based on examination of specimens. For each whale, an attempt was made to measure standard total length, the width of the whale at its widest point, the distance from the tip of the rostrum to the widest point, and the width of the flukes. For southbound gray whales, early migrants were longer on average and more likely to be parturient than those migrating later. Near-term pregnant females were wider relative to their length than other southbound gray whales. This difference was easily detected by visual inspection of the images and through statistical evaluation of length and width data. There was 100% agreement between identification of parturient females based on linear regression analysis of length and width and discriminate analysis of all measurements. Based on the proportion of parturient females to those with calves during sampling of southbound whales, the median calving date was estimated to be 13 January. Southbound calves averaged 4.6m in length; those photographed northbound in late April, at an age of about three months, averaged 7.1m. Average length for yearlings, based on combined southbound and northbound data, was 8.5m. Residuals from a regression of width on length were compared, and significant changes in the relationship were detected which were consistent with changes in nutritive condition or fatness described from examination of whales taken along the California Coast between 1959 and 1969 (Rice and Wolman, 1971). Parturient females were the widest relative to their length and northbound cows with calves were the narrowest in the sample. The relationship between length and width for migrating gray whales that were not parturient or associated with a calf, showed that southbound gray whales were significantly wider than northbound whales photographed approximately 60 days later. These results indicate that the predictable but relatively small changes in condition or fatness of gray whales associated with fasting during their winter migration can be reliably detected in measurements from vertical aerial photographs.","author":[{"family":"Perryman","given":"Wayne L"},{"family":"Lynn","given":"Morgan S"}],"citation-key":"perryman_lynn02","container-title":"Journal of Cetacean Research and Management","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"language":"en","page":"10","source":"Zotero","title":"Evaluation of nutritive condition and reproductive status of migrating gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) based on analysis of photogrammetric data","type":"article-journal"},

Migratory capital breeders acquire most of the energy they need to sustain migration, gestation, and lactation before parturition. Therefore, when predicting the impact of environmental variation on such species, a mechanistic understanding of the physiology of their migratory behavior is required. Using baleen whales as a model system, we developed a dynamic state variable model that captures the interplay among behavioral decisions, energy, reproductive needs, and the environment. We applied the framework to blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) in the eastern North Paciﬁc Ocean and explored the effects of environmental and anthropogenic perturbations on female reproductive success. We demonstrate the emergence of migration to track prey resources, enabling us to quantify the trade-offs among capital breeding, body condition, and metabolic expenses. We predict that periodic climatic oscillations affect reproductive success less than unprecedented environmental changes do. The effect of localized, acute anthropogenic impacts depended on whales’ behavioral response to the disturbance; chronic, but weaker, disturbances had little effect on reproductive success.

  {"id":"pirotta_etal19","abstract":"Animals make behavioural and reproductive decisions that maximise their lifetime reproductive success, and thus their fitness, in light of periodic and stochastic variability of the environment. Modelling the variation of an individual's energy levels formalises this tradeoff and helps to quantify the population-level consequences of stressors (e.g. disturbance from human activities and environmental change) that can affect behaviour or physiology. In this study, we develop a dynamic state variable model for the spatially explicit behaviour, physiology and reproduction of a female, long-lived, migratory marine vertebrate. The model can be used to investigate the spatio-temporal patterns of behaviour and reproduction that allow an individual to maximise its overall reproductive output. We parametrised the model for eastern North Pacific blue whales Balaenoptera musculus, and used it to predict the effects of changing environmental conditions and increasing human disturbance on the population's vital rates. In baseline conditions, the model output had high fidelity to observed energy dynamics, movement patterns and reproductive strategies. Simulated scenarios suggested that environmental changes could have severe consequences on the population's vital rates, but that individuals could tolerate high levels of anthropogenic disturbance. However, this ability depended on where, when and how often disturbance occurred. In scenarios with both environmental change and anthropogenic disturbance, synergistic interactions caused stronger effects than in isolation. In general, larger body size offered a buffer against stochasticity and disturbance, and, consequently, we predicted juveniles to be more susceptible to disturbance. We also predicted that females prioritise their own survival at the expense of the current reproductive attempt, presumably the result of their long lifespan. Our approach provides a general framework to make predictions of the cumulative and synergistic effects of human disturbance and climate change on migratory populations, which can inform effective management and conservation efforts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Pirotta","given":"Enrico"},{"family":"Mangel","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Costa","given":"Daniel P."},{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Jeremy"},{"family":"Harwood","given":"John"},{"family":"Hin","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Irvine","given":"Ladd M."},{"family":"Mate","given":"Bruce R."},{"family":"McHuron","given":"Elizabeth A."},{"family":"Palacios","given":"Daniel M."},{"family":"Schwarz","given":"Lisa K."},{"family":"New","given":"Leslie"}],"citation-key":"pirotta_etal19","container-title":"Oikos","DOI":"10.1111/oik.06146","ISSN":"1600-0706","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"1340-1357","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Anthropogenic disturbance in a changing environment: modelling lifetime reproductive success to predict the consequences of multiple stressors on a migratory population","title-short":"Anthropogenic disturbance in a changing environment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/oik.06146","volume":"128"},
  {"id":"pirotta_etal21","abstract":"The recovery of overexploited populations is likely to reveal behaviours that may have been present prior to harvest but are only now reappearing as the population size increases. The east Australian humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) population (group V, stock E1) has recovered well from past exploitation and is now estimated to be close to the pre-whaling population size. Humpback whales were thought to follow a ‘feast and famine’ model historically, feeding intensively in high-latitude feeding grounds and then fasting while migrating and in calving grounds; however, there is growing evidence that animals may feed outside of known foraging grounds. This short article reports on the first photographically documented evidence of bubble-net feeding by humpback whales in Australian coastal waters (n = 10 groups observed) and provides the first evidence of a second site in the southern hemisphere for the formation of ‘super-groups’ (n = 6 super-groups at discrete locations). The formation of super-groups may be linked to changes in the type or density of prey available, either along the migratory route or in the feeding grounds of the previous summer. It is also possible that the increased population size following recovery make large group sizes while feeding more common. These findings strongly support evidence that feeding behaviour is not restricted to high-latitude foraging grounds in the Southern Ocean, and that prey consumption prior to leaving the coastal waters of Australia may be a significant component of the migratory ecology of this population. Understanding how environmental variation influences the extent to which humpback whales depend on foraging opportunities along their migratory route, and where feeding occurs, will help to predict how future changes in the ocean will influence whale populations. This will also allow for more effective management measures to reduce the impact of threats during this important period of energy consumption.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Pirotta","given":"Vanessa"},{"family":"Owen","given":"Kylie"},{"family":"Donnelly","given":"David"},{"family":"Brasier","given":"Madeleine J."},{"family":"Harcourt","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"pirotta_etal21","container-title":"Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems","DOI":"10.1002/aqc.3621","ISSN":"1099-0755","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","page":"2412-2419","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"First evidence of bubble-net feeding and the formation of ‘super-groups’ by the east Australian population of humpback whales during their southward migration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aqc.3621","volume":"31"},
  {"id":"pirotta_etal21a","abstract":"Assessing the long-term consequences of sub-lethal anthropogenic disturbance on wildlife populations requires integrating data on fine-scale individual behavior and physiology into spatially and temporally broader, population-level inference. A typical behavioral response to disturbance is the cessation of foraging, which can be translated into a common metric of energetic cost. However, this necessitates detailed empirical information on baseline movements, activity budgets, feeding rates and energy intake, as well as the probability of an individual responding to the disturbance-inducing stressor within different exposure contexts. Here, we integrated data from blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) experimentally exposed to military active sonar signals with fine-scale measurements of baseline behavior over multiple days or weeks obtained from accelerometry loggers, telemetry tracking and prey sampling. Specifically, we developed daily simulations of movement, feeding behavior and exposure to localized sonar events of increasing duration and intensity and predicted the effects of this disturbance source on the daily energy intake of an individual. Activity budgets and movements were highly variable in space and time and among individuals, resulting in large variability in predicted energetic intake and costs. In half of our simulations, an individual’s energy intake was unaffected by the simulated source. However, some individuals lost their entire daily energy intake under brief or weak exposure scenarios. Given this large variation, population-level models will have to assess the consequences of the entire distribution of energetic costs, rather than only consider single summary statistics. The shape of the exposure-response functions also strongly influenced predictions, reinforcing the need for contextually explicit experiments and improved mechanistic understanding of the processes driving behavioral and physiological responses to disturbance. This study presents a robust approach for integrating different types of empirical information to assess the effects of disturbance at spatio-temporal and ecological scales that are relevant to management and conservation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Pirotta","given":"Enrico"},{"family":"Booth","given":"Cormac G"},{"family":"Cade","given":"David E"},{"family":"Calambokidis","given":"John"},{"family":"Costa","given":"Daniel P"},{"family":"Fahlbusch","given":"James A"},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari S"},{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Jeremy A"},{"family":"Harwood","given":"John"},{"family":"Hazen","given":"Elliott L"},{"family":"New","given":"Leslie"},{"family":"Southall","given":"Brandon L"}],"citation-key":"pirotta_etal21a","container-title":"Conservation Physiology","container-title-short":"Conservation Physiology","DOI":"10.1093/conphys/coaa137","ISSN":"2051-1434","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"page":"coaa137","source":"Silverchair","title":"Context-dependent variability in the predicted daily energetic costs of disturbance for blue whales","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/conphys/coaa137","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"pitman_etal15","abstract":"Reports of killer whales (Orcinus orca) preying on large whales have been relatively rare, and the ecological significance of these attacks is controversial. Here we report on numerous observations of killer whales preying on neonate humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) off Western Australia (WA) based on reports we compiled and our own observations. Attacking killer whales included at least 19 individuals from three stable social groupings in a highly connected local population; 22 separate attacks with known outcomes resulted in at least 14 (64%) kills of humpback calves. We satellite-tagged an adult female killer whale and followed her group on the water for 20.3 h over six separate days. During that time, they attacked eight humpback calves, and from the seven known outcomes, at least three calves (43%) were killed. Overall, our observations suggest that humpback calves are a predictable, plentiful, and readily taken prey source for killer whales and scavenging sharks off WA for at least 5 mo/yr. Humpback “escorts” vigorously assisted mothers in protecting their calves from attacking killer whales (and a white shark, Carcharodon carcharias). This expands the purported role of escorts in humpback whale social interactions, although it is not clear how this behavior is adaptive for the escorts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Pitman","given":"Robert L."},{"family":"Totterdell","given":"John A."},{"family":"Fearnbach","given":"Holly"},{"family":"Ballance","given":"Lisa T."},{"family":"Durban","given":"John W."},{"family":"Kemps","given":"Hans"}],"citation-key":"pitman_etal15","container-title":"Marine Mammal Science","DOI":"10.1111/mms.12182","ISSN":"1748-7692","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2014 The Authors.

The elastic modulus (i.e., stiffness) and hysteresis (i.e., energy dissipation) of digital flexor, ankle extensor, and digital extensor tendons from 18 species of adult quadrupedal mammals ranging in body mass from 0.5 to 545 kg were determined by cyclic tensile testing in vitro. The results show that these elastic properties do not vary significantly among tendons from animals of different body mass, nor do they differ between the digital flexor and ankle extensor tendons (those situated to act as springs during locomotion) and the digital extensor tendons (those not likely to function as springs during locomotion). Consequently, the inherent capability of different limb tendons to store elastic energy, based on their material properties, is the same for large and small animals. The relationship between tendon elastic modulus (E; in GPa) and body mass (Mb; in kg) is described by the allometric equation E = 1.22Mb0.00. The hysteresis (H), as a percentage of total strain energy, is related to body mass as H = 8.89Mb-0.03.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Pollock","given":"C.

  {"id":"potvin_etal10","abstract":"Rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae) obtain their food by lunge feeding, a dynamic process that involves the intermittent engulfment and ﬁltering of large amounts of water and prey. During a lunge, whales accelerate to high speed and open their mouth wide, thereby exposing a highly distensible buccal cavity to the ﬂow and facilitating its inﬂation. Unsteady hydrodynamic models suggest that the muscles associated with the ventral groove blubber undergo eccentric contraction in order to stiffen and control the inﬂation of the buccal cavity; in doing so the engulfed water mass is accelerated forward as the whale’s body slows down. Although the basic mechanics of lunge feeding are relatively well known, the scaling of this process remains poorly understood, particularly with regards to its duration (from mouth opening to closure). Here we formulate a new theory of engulfment time which integrates prey escape behavior with the mechanics of the whale’s body, including lunge speed and acceleration, gape angle dynamics, and the controlled inﬂation of the buccal cavity. Given that the complex interaction between these factors must be highly coordinated in order to maximize engulfment volume, the proposed formulation rests on the scenario of Synchronized Engulfment, whereby the ﬁlling of the cavity (posterior to the temporomandibular joint) coincides with the moment of maximum gape. When formulated speciﬁcally for large rorquals feeding on krill, our analysis predicts that engulfment time increases with body size, but in amounts dictated by the speciﬁcs of krill escape and avoidance kinematics. The predictions generated by the model are corroborated by limited empirical data on a species-speciﬁc basis, particularly for humpback and blue whales chasing krill. A sensitivity analysis applied to all possible sized ﬁn whales also suggests that engulfment duration and lunge speed will increase intraspeciﬁcally with body size under a wide range of predator–prey scenarios. This study provides the theoretical framework required to estimate the scaling of the mass-speciﬁc drag being generated during engulfment, as well as the energy expenditures incurred.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Potvin","given":"J."},{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"J.A."},{"family":"Shadwick","given":"R.E."}],"citation-key":"potvin_etal10","container-title":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.08.026","ISSN":"00225193","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","page":"437-453","source":"Crossref","title":"Scaling of lunge feeding in rorqual whales: An integrated model of engulfment duration","title-short":"Scaling of lunge feeding in rorqual whales","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022519310004492","volume":"267"},
  {"id":"potvin_etal12","abstract":"Bulk-filter feeding is an energetically efficient strategy for resource acquisition and assimilation, and facilitates the maintenance of extreme body size as exemplified by baleen whales (Mysticeti) and multiple lineages of bony and cartilaginous fishes. Among mysticetes, rorqual whales (Balaenopteridae) exhibit an intermittent ram filter feeding mode, lunge feeding, which requires the abandonment of body-streamlining in favor of a high-drag, mouth-open configuration aimed at engulfing a very large amount of prey-laden water. Particularly while lunge feeding on krill (the most widespread prey preference among rorquals), the effort required during engulfment involve short bouts of high-intensity muscle activity that demand high metabolic output. We used computational modeling together with morphological and kinematic data on humpback (Megaptera noveaangliae), fin (Balaenoptera physalus), blue (Balaenoptera musculus) and minke (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) whales to estimate engulfment power output in comparison with standard metrics of metabolic rate. The simulations reveal that engulfment metabolism increases across the full body size of the larger rorqual species to nearly 50 times the basal metabolic rate of terrestrial mammals of the same body mass. Moreover, they suggest that the metabolism of the largest body sizes runs with significant oxygen deficits during mouth opening, namely, 20% over maximum V_ O2at the size of the largest blue whales, thus requiring significant contributions from anaerobic catabolism during a lunge and significant recovery after a lunge. Our analyses show that engulfment metabolism is also significantly lower for smaller adults, typically one-tenth to one-half V_ O2jmax. These results not only point to a physiological limit on maximum body size in this lineage, but also have major implications for the ontogeny of extant rorquals as well as the evolutionary pathways used by ancestral toothed whales to transition from hunting individual prey items to filter feeding on prey aggregations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Potvin","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Jeremy A."},{"family":"Shadwick","given":"Robert E."}],"citation-key":"potvin_etal12","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0044854","editor":[{"family":"Fahlman","given":"Andreas"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","page":"e44854","source":"Crossref","title":"Metabolic Expenditures of Lunge Feeding Rorquals Across Scale: Implications for the Evolution of Filter Feeding and the Limits to Maximum Body Size","title-short":"Metabolic Expenditures of Lunge Feeding Rorquals Across Scale","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0044854","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"potvin_etal21","abstract":"Humpback and blue whales are large baleen-bearing cetaceans, which use a unique prey-acquisition strategy—lunge feeding—to engulf entire patches of large plankton or schools of forage fish and the water in which they are embedded. Dynamically, and while foraging on krill, lunge-feeding incurs metabolic expenditures estimated at up to 20.0 MJ. Because of prey abundance and its capture in bulk, lunge feeding is carried out at high acquired-to-expended energy ratios of up to 30 at the largest body sizes (∼27 m). We use bio-logging tag data and the work-energy theorem to show that when krill-feeding at depth while using a wide range of prey approach swimming speeds (2–5 m/s), rorquals generate significant and widely varying metabolic power output during engulfment, typically ranging from 10 to 50 times the basal metabolic rate of land mammals. At equal prey field density, such output variations lower their feeding efficiency two- to three-fold at high foraging speeds, thereby allowing slow and smaller rorquals to feed more efficiently than fast and larger rorquals. The analysis also shows how the slowest speeds of harvest so far measured may be connected to the biomechanics of the buccal cavity and the prey’s ability to collectively avoid engulfment. Such minimal speeds are important as they generate the most efficient lunges.SommaireLes rorquals à bosse et rorquals bleus sont des baleines à fanons qui utilisent une technique d’alimentation unique impliquant une approche avec élan pour engouffrer de larges quantités de plancton et bancs de petits poissons, ainsi que la masse d’eau dans laquelle ces proies sont situés. Du point de vue de la dynamique, et durant l’approche et engouffrement de krill, leurs dépenses énergétiques sont estimées jusqu’à 20.0 MJ. À cause de l’abondance de leurs proies et capture en masse, cette technique d’alimentation est effectuée à des rapports d’efficacité énergétique (acquise -versus- dépensée) estimés aux environs de 30 dans le cas des plus grandes baleines (27 m). Nous utilisons les données recueillies par des capteurs de bio-enregistrement ainsi que le théorème reliant l’énergie à l’effort pour démontrer comment les rorquals s’alimentant sur le krill à grandes profondeurs, et à des vitesses variant entre 2 et 5 m/s, maintiennent des taux de dépenses énergétiques entre 10 et 50 fois le taux métabolique basal des mammifères terrestres. À densités de proies égales, ces variations d’énergie utilisée peuvent réduire le rapport d’efficacité énergétique par des facteurs entre 2x et 3x, donc permettant aux petits et plus lents rorquals de chasser avec une efficacité comparable à celle des rorquals les plus grands et rapides. Notre analyse démontre aussi comment des vitesses d’approche plus lentes peuvent être reliées à la biomécanique de leur poche ventrale extensible, et à l’habilitée des proies à éviter d’être engouffrer. Ces minimums de vitesses sont importants car ils permettent une alimentation plus efficace énergétiquement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Potvin","given":"J"},{"family":"Cade","given":"D E"},{"family":"Werth","given":"A J"},{"family":"Shadwick","given":"R E"},{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"J A"}],"citation-key":"potvin_etal21","container-title":"Integrative Organismal Biology","container-title-short":"Integrative Organismal Biology","DOI":"10.1093/iob/obab005","ISSN":"2517-4843","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"source":"Silverchair","title":"Rorqual Lunge-Feeding Energetics Near and Away from the Kinematic Threshold of Optimal Efficiency","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/iob/obab005","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"pyenson_etal14","abstract":"The dominant consumers in today's ocean ecosystems are marine mammals, including cetaceans, sirenians, and pinnipeds, and other marine carnivorans. The ecological dominance of marine mammals can be traced back to at least seven independent transitions during the Cenozoic, when different lineages of terrestrial mammals underwent land to sea evolutionary transformations. However, the evolution of marine mammals represents only the most recent set of marine invasions by tetrapods over the past 250 Ma. During the Mesozoic, over a dozen different reptile lineages (e.g., mosasaurs, ichthyosaurs, turtles, snakes) evolved obligate marine lineages, including a few lineages that persist to today, such as sea turtles. Birds, which are phylogenetically nested among diapsid reptiles, have also repeatedly adapted to marine life since the Cretaceous. Attempts to understand the common patterns of marine tetrapod evolution, and the processes that have shaped them, have largely been limited to individual groups. Placed in a broad comparative view from the Mesozoic to the Cenozoic eras, the macroevolution of marine tetrapods reveals evolutionary drivers at different scales, along with morphological parallels, unique evolutionary innovations, and the strong inﬂuence of historical constraints. Major physical, environmental drivers appear to be responsible for some patterns in marine tetrapod evolution at some temporal and geographic scales, but these drivers are not unique causes, as biological drivers (e.g., escalation) likely also play a role. The culmination of this trophic ascendancy has been dramatically altered by human hunting (especially of marine mammals), underscoring the need for historical datasets that extend into deep time to understand the ecological history of marine tetrapods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Pyenson","given":"Nicholas D."},{"family":"Kelley","given":"Neil P."},{"family":"Parham","given":"James F."}],"citation-key":"pyenson_etal14","container-title":"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology","DOI":"10.1016/j.palaeo.2014.02.018","ISSN":"00310182","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","page":"1-8","source":"Crossref","title":"Marine tetrapod macroevolution: Physical and biological drivers on 250 Ma of invasions and evolution in ocean ecosystems","title-short":"Marine tetrapod macroevolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S003101821400090X","volume":"400"},

  {"id":"pyke_etal77","abstract":"Beginning with Emlen (1966) and MacArthur and Pianka (1966) and extending through the last ten years, several authors have sought to predict the foraging behavior of animals by means of mathematical models. These models are very similar,in that they all assume that the fitness of a foraging animal is a function of the efficiency of foraging measured in terms of some \"currency\" (Schoener, 1971) -usually energy- and that natural selection has resulted in animals that forage so as to maximize this fitness. As a result of these similarities, the models have become known as \"optimal foraging models\"; and the theory that embodies them, \"optimal foraging theory.\" The situations to which optimal foraging theory has been applied, with the exception of a few recent studies, can be divided into the following four categories: (1) choice by an animal of which food types to eat (i.e., optimal diet); (2) choice of which patch type to feed in (i.e., optimal patch choice); (3) optimal allocation of time to different patches; and (4) optimal patterns and speed of movements. In this review we discuss each of these categories separately, dealing with both the theoretical developments and the data that permit tests of the predictions. The review is selective in the sense that we emphasize studies that either develop testable predictions or that attempt to test predictions in a precise quantitative manner. We also discuss what we see to be some of the future developments in the area of optimal foraging theory and how this theory can be related to other areas of biology. Our general conclusion is that the simple models so far formulated are supported are supported reasonably well by available data and that we are optimistic about the value both now and in the future of optimal foraging theory. We argue, however, that these simple models will requre much modification, espicially to deal with situations that either cannot easily be put into one or another of the above four categories or entail currencies more complicated that just energy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Pyke","given":"G.

  {"id":"rall_etal12","abstract":"Knowledge of feeding rates is the basis to understand interaction strength and subsequently the stability of ecosystems and biodiversity. Feeding rates, as all biological rates, depend on consumer and resource body masses and environmental temperature. Despite five decades of research on functional responses as quantitative models of feeding rates, a unifying framework of how they scale with body masses and temperature is still lacking. This is perplexing, considering that the strength of functional responses (i.e. interaction strengths) is crucially important for the stability of simple consumer–resource systems and the persistence, sustainability and biodiversity of complex communities. Here, we present the largest currently available database on functional response parameters and their scaling with body mass and temperature. Moreover, these data are integrated across ecosystems and metabolic types of species. Surprisingly, we found general temperature dependencies that differed from the Arrhenius terms predicted by metabolic models. Additionally, the body-mass-scaling relationships were more complex than expected and differed across ecosystems and metabolic types. At local scales (taxonomically narrow groups of consumer–resource pairs), we found hump-shaped deviations from the temperature and body-mass-scaling relationships. Despite the complexity of our results, these body-mass- and temperature-scaling models remain useful as a mechanistic basis for predicting the consequences of warming for interaction strengths, population dynamics and network stability across communities differing in their size structure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Rall","given":"Björn C."},{"family":"Brose","given":"Ulrich"},{"family":"Hartvig","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Kalinkat","given":"Gregor"},{"family":"Schwarzmüller","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Vucic-Pestic","given":"Olivera"},{"family":"Petchey","given":"Owen L."}],"citation-key":"rall_etal12","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Phil.

We document seven individuals, including a mother/calf pair, that made this migration (approx. 8300 km), the longest movement undertaken by any mammal. Whales were observed as far north as 11° N off Costa Rica, in an area also used by a boreal population during the opposite winter season, resulting in unique spatial overlap between Northern and Southern Hemisphere populations. The occurrence of such a northerly wintering area is coincident with the development of an equatorial tongue of cold water in the eastern South Pacific, a pattern that is repeated in the eastern South Atlantic. A survey of location and water temperature at the wintering areas worldwide indicates that they are found in warm waters (21.1–28.3°C), irrespective of latitude. We contend that while availability of suitable reproductive habitat in the wintering areas is important at the fine scale, water temperature influences whale distribution at the basin scale. Calf development in warm water may lead to larger adult size and increased reproductive success, a strategy that supports the energy conservation hypothesis as a reason for migration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Rasmussen","given":"Kristin"},{"family":"Palacios","given":"Daniel M"},{"family":"Calambokidis","given":"John"},{"family":"Saborío","given":"Marco T"},{"family":"Dalla Rosa","given":"Luciano"},{"family":"Secchi","given":"Eduardo R"},{"family":"Steiger","given":"Gretchen H"},{"family":"Allen","given":"Judith M"},{"family":"Stone","given":"Gregory S"}],"citation-key":"rasmussen_etal07","container-title":"Biology Letters","DOI":"10.1098/rsbl.2007.0067","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"page":"302-305","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Southern Hemisphere humpback whales wintering off Central America: insights from water temperature into the longest mammalian migration","title-short":"Southern Hemisphere humpback whales wintering off Central America","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2007.0067","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"ratsimbazafindranahaka_etal22","abstract":"Getting maternal milk through nursing is vital for all newborn mammals. Despite its importance, nursing has been poorly documented in humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). Nursing is difficult to observe underwater without disturbing the whales and is usually impossible to observe from a ship. We attempted to observe nursing from the calf’s perspective by placing CATS cam tags on three humpback whale calves in the Sainte Marie channel, Madagascar, Indian Ocean, during the breeding seasons. CATS cam tags are animal-borne multi-sensor tags equipped with a video camera, a hydrophone, and several auxiliary sensors (including a 3-axis accelerometer, a 3-axis magnetometer, and a depth sensor). The use of multi-sensor tags minimized potential disturbance from human presence. A total of 10.52 h of video recordings were collected with the corresponding auxiliary data. Video recordings were manually analyzed and correlated with the auxiliary data, allowing us to extract different kinematic features including the depth rate, speed, Fluke Stroke Rate (FSR), Overall Body Dynamic Acceleration (ODBA), pitch, roll, and roll rate. We found that suckling events lasted 18.8 ± 8.8 s on average (N = 34) and were performed mostly during dives. Suckling events represented 1.7% of the total observation time. During suckling, the calves were visually estimated to be at a 30–45° pitch angle relative to the midline of their mother’s body and were always observed rolling either to the right or to the left. In our auxiliary dataset, we confirmed that suckling behavior was primarily characterized by a high average absolute roll and additionally we also found that it was likely characterized by a high average FSR and a low average speed. Kinematic features were used for supervised machine learning in order to subsequently detect suckling behavior automatically. Our study is a proof of method on which future investigations can build upon. It opens new opportunities for further investigation of suckling behavior in humpback whales and the baleen whale species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Ratsimbazafindranahaka","given":"Maevatiana N."},{"family":"Huetz","given":"Chloé"},{"family":"Andrianarimisa","given":"Aristide"},{"family":"Reidenberg","given":"Joy S."},{"family":"Saloma","given":"Anjara"},{"family":"Adam","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Charrier","given":"Isabelle"}],"citation-key":"ratsimbazafindranahaka_etal22","container-title":"PeerJ","container-title-short":"PeerJ","DOI":"10.7717/peerj.12945","ISSN":"2167-8359","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"language":"en","page":"e12945","publisher":"PeerJ Inc.","source":"peerj.com","title":"Characterizing the suckling behavior by video and 3D-accelerometry in humpback whale calves on a breeding ground","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://peerj.com/articles/12945","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"rayner85","abstract":"The problem of fitting a linear relation to a bivariate data cluster obtained from morphometric measurement or from experiment is formulated rigorously, and a family of solutions (the general structural relation, g.s.r.) is derived. The regression, reduced major axis and major axis models are special cases of this model; it permits a more realistic treatment of the errors in the variates, in particular when the errors are correlated, which is particularly important in the many biological situations in which the variates contain uncontrolled real variation in addition to measurement errors. The analysis is particularly directed to the testing of hypotheses about scaling relations derived from biomechanical theory. By making different assumptions about the configuration of the errors, the g.s.r. can also be used to test for transposition allometry and for the significance of an estimated or hypothesized gradient. The model generalizes simply to multivariate problems. Application is demonstrated with examples drawn from the study of bird flight mechanics. Finally, it is demonstrated that since observed quantities correspond to peaks of adaptation or of selective fitness, scaling relations are determined primarily by scale variation of constraints on adaptation and behaviour, and are the result of a variety of interacting factors rather than a response to a single selective force described by one simple hypothesis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Rayner","given":"J.

  {"id":"read_harvey89","abstract":"In this paper, we critically evaluate the view that eutherian life history diversity arises because of constraints imposed by the allometric consequences of body size, rather than selection acting on a broad array of possible life histories. Using life history data from over 700 species of eutherians, we examine covariation of life history variables across the 18 orders represented. Eutherian orders can be arranged from those characterized by small rapidly reproducing, rapidly developing, short-lived species, such as lagomorphs, to large, slowly developing, slowly reproducing, long lived species, such as elephants. When the effect of body weight is controlled for, this pattern remains, but the relative positions ofthe orders on the new fast-slow continuum are very different. There is a trade-off between the weight and number of offspring in a litter which is independent of adult body weight. Maximum recorded lifespan is the best identified predictor of annual fecundity: high fecundity is associated with short lives. This is not easily explained as a cost of reproduction, because it is a function of the whole lifetime, rather than just the maximum reproductive lifespan. Those mechanisms said to underlie the allometric scaling of life histories, and which make testable predictions–growth constraints imposed by basal metabolic rate, brain weight and the rate of neuronal tissue growth–are not associated with life history variation once the effects of body weight are removed. Thus these variables have no greater explanatory power than body weight itself, since they cannot explain the variation in life histories which is not correlated with weight. Rates of litter growth rate are associated with life history variation independent of body weight, but until we understand why litter growth rates vary, they are unable, on their own, to explain considerable amounts of life history diversity. Differences in life histories among orders, whether or not the effect of body weight is controlled for, are associated with differences in mortality rates. We suggest that eutherian life histories are better thought of as adaptive strategies, and that mortality patterns offer considerably more promise in the understanding of eutherian life history diversity than loosely defined ideas about scaling principles and the allometric consequences of body size.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Read","given":"A.

  {"id":"reisinger_etal21","abstract":"Machine learning algorithms are often used to model and predict animal habitat selection—the relationships between animal occurrences and habitat characteristics. For broadly distributed species, habitat selection often varies among populations and regions; thus, it would seem preferable to fit region- or population-specific models of habitat selection for more accurate inference and prediction, rather than fitting large-scale models using pooled data. However, where the aim is to make range-wide predictions, including areas for which there are no existing data or models of habitat selection, how can regional models best be combined? We propose that ensemble approaches commonly used to combine different algorithms for a single region can be reframed, treating regional habitat selection models as the candidate models. By doing so, we can incorporate regional variation when fitting predictive models of animal habitat selection across large ranges. We test this approach using satellite telemetry data from 168 humpback whales across five geographic regions in the Southern Ocean. Using random forests, we fitted a large-scale model relating humpback whale locations, versus background locations, to 10 environmental covariates, and made a circumpolar prediction of humpback whale habitat selection. We also fitted five regional models, the predictions of which we used as input features for four ensemble approaches: an unweighted ensemble, an ensemble weighted by environmental similarity in each cell, stacked generalization, and a hybrid approach wherein the environmental covariates and regional predictions were used as input features in a new model. We tested the predictive performance of these approaches on an independent validation dataset of humpback whale sightings and whaling catches. These multiregional ensemble approaches resulted in models with higher predictive performance than the circumpolar naive model. These approaches can be used to incorporate regional variation in animal habitat selection when fitting range-wide predictive models using machine learning algorithms. This can yield more accurate predictions across regions or populations of animals that may show variation in habitat selection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Reisinger","given":"Ryan R."},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari S."},{"family":"Zerbini","given":"Alexandre N."},{"family":"Palacios","given":"Daniel M."},{"family":"Andrews-Goff","given":"Virginia"},{"family":"Dalla Rosa","given":"Luciano"},{"family":"Double","given":"Mike"},{"family":"Findlay","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Garrigue","given":"Claire"},{"family":"How","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Jenner","given":"Curt"},{"family":"Jenner","given":"Micheline-Nicole"},{"family":"Mate","given":"Bruce"},{"family":"Rosenbaum","given":"Howard C."},{"family":"Seakamela","given":"S.

Understanding how different behaviors (e.g. foraging) are shaped by dynamic environmental features is fundamental to understanding ecological interactions and the impact of variability. In this study we deployed satellite-linked tags on humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and used state-space models to estimate locations and to infer underlying behavioral states. We then modelled the association between whale behavior (e.g. foraging or transiting) and environmental variables using linear mixed-effect models. We identified the importance of two recently discovered Southern Ocean feeding areas for Oceania humpback whales as well as the key environmental drivers affecting whale behavior. We detected behavioral differences between whales utilizing the two adjacent feeding regions (~2000 km apart), which were likely caused by animals trying to efficiently locate prey in relation to the dynamic environmental characteristics of each habitat. We observed a seasonal pattern in foraging behavior, with the peak occurring in the middle of summer. Whales also foraged more intensively with increasing proximity to areas from which the ice edge had recently retreated, suggesting heightened productivity in these areas. The relationship between the animals and the physical features of the seascape, as well as the behavioral plasticity observed, could have implications for the future recovery of these whales in a changing Southern Ocean.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Riekkola","given":"Leena"},{"family":"Andrews-Goff","given":"Virginia"},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari"},{"family":"Constantine","given":"Rochelle"},{"family":"Zerbini","given":"Alexandre N."}],"citation-key":"riekkola_etal19","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jembe.2019.05.008","ISSN":"00220981","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"1-12","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Environmental drivers of humpback whale foraging behavior in the remote Southern Ocean","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022098119300152","volume":"517"},
  {"id":"riekkola_etal20","abstract":"Long-distance migration is a demanding physical activity, and how well animals manage the associated costs will have important implications for their fitness. The Oceania humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) population is recovering from past exploitation markedly slower than the neighbouring east Australian whales. The reasons for this are unknown, although higher energetic costs of longer migratory distances could be a possible explanation. Due to their fully aquatic lives, studying the energy expenditure of these large animals requires methods that do not rely on capturing the animal, such as bioenergetic models. A state-space model was fitted to satellite data to infer behavioural states for southern migrating whales. Travel speeds and behavioural states were used in a bioenergetic model to estimate the energetic cost of the migration phase. Relative differences in average duration, distance, and energetic costs were compared between migratory routes and distances. Total energy used during migration was a trade-off between cost of transport (determined by travel speed) and daily maintenance (determined by daily basal metabolic costs). Oceania whales migrating to the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas travelled fastest and furthest, 15 and 21% further than whales migrating to the d'Urville Sea (east Australian whales) and Ross Sea, respectively. Therefore, they had the highest cost of transport, 25 and 85% higher than for d'Urville Sea and Ross Sea whales, respectively. However, energy saved in terms of daily maintenance by using fewer days to complete a longer migration resulted in only a 6–7% increase in total energetic cost. The results highlight that travelling further does not necessarily translate into an increase in total energy expenditure for migratory whales, since they can compensate for longer distance by travelling faster. Further research on the energetics of different whale populations could provide insight into the productivity of Southern Ocean feeding regions and help understand the environmental and anthropogenic effects on the whales' energy budgets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Riekkola","given":"Leena"},{"family":"Andrews-Goff","given":"Virginia"},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari"},{"family":"Zerbini","given":"Alexandre N."},{"family":"Constantine","given":"Rochelle"}],"citation-key":"riekkola_etal20","container-title":"Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems","DOI":"10.1002/aqc.3295","ISSN":"1099-0755","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","page":"937-948","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Longer migration not necessarily the costliest strategy for migrating humpback whales","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aqc.3295","volume":"30"},
  {"id":"risch_etal13","abstract":"Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a rapidly growing field, providing valuable insights in marine ecology. The approach allows for long-term, species-specific monitoring over a range of spatial scales. For many baleen whales fundamental information on seasonal occurrence and distribution is still missing. In this study, pulse trains produced by the North Atlantic minke whale, a highly mobile and cryptic species, are used to examine its seasonality, diel vocalization patterns and spatial distribution throughout the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (SBNMS), USA. Three and a half years (2006, 2007 to 2010) of near continuous passive acoustic data were analyzed using automated detection methods. Random forests and cluster analyses grouped pulse trains into 3 main categories (slow-down, constant and speed-up), with several subtypes. Slow-down pulse trains were the most commonly recorded call category. Minke whale pulse train occurrence was highly seasonal across all years. Detections were made from August to November, with 88% occurring in September and October. No detections were recorded in January and February, and only few from March to June. Minke whale pulse trains showed a distinct diel pattern, with a nighttime peak from approximately 20:00 to 01:00 h Eastern Standard Time (EST). The highest numbers of pulse trains were detected to the east of Stellwagen Bank, suggesting that minke whales travel preferably in deeper waters along the outer edge of the sanctuary. These data show that minke whales consistently use Stellwagen Bank as part of their migration route to and from the feeding grounds. Unlike other baleen whales in this area they do not appear to have a persistent year-round acoustic presence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Risch","given":"D"},{"family":"Clark","given":"Cw"},{"family":"Dugan","given":"Pj"},{"family":"Popescu","given":"M"},{"family":"Siebert","given":"U"},{"family":"Van Parijs","given":"Sm"}],"citation-key":"risch_etal13","container-title":"Marine Ecology Progress Series","container-title-short":"Mar.

  {"id":"robbins_etal11","abstract":"Humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae are seasonal migrants that mate and calve at low latitudes and feed at mid- to high latitudes. Connections between most Southern Hemisphere breeding and feeding areas are not well understood, but are critical for assessing stock structure and human impacts. Photo-identification was performed to identify the feeding grounds of an Endangered sub-population that breeds in the central South Pacific Ocean (CSP). Identification photographs were obtained from 159 ind. at American Samoa and compared to 3508 Southern Hemisphere humpback whales in the Antarctic Humpback Whale Catalogue (AHWC), including 1352 from Antarctic feeding grounds. Two individuals from American Samoa were seen on 3 occasions at the Antarctic Peninsula. This is the first known feeding site for American Samoa and one of few reliably identified for the CSP. AHWC #2950 was confirmed to have undertaken a round-trip movement of no less than 18 840 km, spanning 108 longitudinal degrees. This represents the largest mammalian migration known to date and a departure from historical assumptions about CSP migratory patterns. The frequency, causes, and fitness implications of such movements have yet to be determined. However, distance is the only known extrinsic barrier to humpback whale movement within oceans, and so maximum individual range is 1 factor potentially affecting population exchange and colonization of new habitats. The movement documented here may place this Endangered sub-population at risk if conservation efforts are relaxed in unidentified parts of its range. Yet, the ability of humpback whales to undertake such extensive movements may have also contributed to the apparent recovery of some populations versus other historically exploited whale species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Robbins","given":"J"},{"family":"Dalla Rosa","given":"L"},{"family":"Allen","given":"Jm"},{"family":"Mattila","given":"Dk"},{"family":"Secchi","given":"Er"},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"As"},{"family":"Stevick","given":"Pt"},{"family":"Nowacek","given":"Dp"},{"family":"Steele","given":"D"}],"citation-key":"robbins_etal11","container-title":"Endangered Species Research","container-title-short":"Endang.

  {"id":"roberts_azizi11","abstract":"The muscles that power vertebrate locomotion are associated with springy tissues, both within muscle and in connective tissue elements such as tendons. These springs share in common the same simple action: they stretch and store elastic strain energy when force is applied to them and recoil to release energy when force decays. Although this elastic action is simple, it serves a diverse set of functions, including metabolic energy conservation, amplification of muscle power output, attenuation of muscle power input, and rapid mechanical feedback that may aid in stability. In recent years, our understanding of the mechanisms and importance of biological springs in locomotion has advanced significantly, and it has been demonstrated that elastic mechanisms are essential for the effective function of the muscle motors that power movement. Here, we review some recent advances in our understanding of elastic mechanisms, with an emphasis on two proposed organizing principles. First, we review the evidence that the various functions of biological springs allow the locomotor system to operate beyond the bounds of intrinsic muscle properties, including metabolic and mechanical characteristics, as well as motor control processes. Second, we propose that an energy-based framework is useful for interpreting the diverse functions of series-elastic springs. In this framework, the direction and timing of the flow of energy between the body, the elastic element and the contracting muscle determine the function served by the elastic mechanism (e.g. energy conservation vs power amplification). We also review recent work demonstrating that structures such as tendons remodel more actively and behave more dynamically than previously assumed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Roberts","given":"T.

  {"id":"rohr_fish04","abstract":"Summary Swimming efficiencies of ﬁsh and cetaceans have been related to a certain synchrony between stroke cycle frequency, peak-to-peak tail/ﬂuke amplitude and mean swimming speed. These kinematic parameters form a nondimensional wake parameter, referred to as a Strouhal number, which for the range between 0.20 and 0.40 has been associated with enhanced swimming efficiency for ﬁsh and cetaceans. Yet to date there has been no direct experimental substantiation of what Strouhal numbers are preferred by swimming cetaceans. To address this lack of data, a total of 248 Strouhal numbers were calculated for the captive odontocete cetaceans Tursiops truncatus, Pseudorca crassidens, Orcinus orca, Globicephala melaena, Lagenorhynchus obliquidens and Stenella frontalis. Although the average Strouhal number calculated for each species is within the accepted range, considerable scatter is found in the data both within species and among individuals. A greater proportion of Strouhal values occur between 0.20 and 0.30 (74%) than the 0.25–0.35 (55%) range predicted for maximum swimming efficiency. Within 0.05 Strouhal increments, the greatest number of Strouhal values was found between 0.225 and 0.275 (44%). Where propulsive efficiency data were available (Tursiops truncatus, Pseudorca crassidens, Orcinus orca), peak swimming efficiency corresponded to this same Strouhal range. The odontocete cetacean data show that, besides being generally limited to a range of Strouhal numbers between 0.20 and 0.40, the kinematic parameters comprising the Strouhal number provide additional constraints. Fluke-beat frequency normalized by the ratio of swimming speed to body length was generally restricted from 1 to 2, whereas peak-to-peak ﬂuke amplitude normalized by body length occurred predominantly between 0.15 and 0.25. The results indicate that the kinematics of the propulsive ﬂukes of odontocete cetaceans are not solely dependent on Strouhal number, and the Strouhal number range for odontocete cetaceans occurs at slightly (~20%) lower values than previously predicted for maximum swimming efficiency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Rohr","given":"J.

The ability to accumulate sufficient energy reserves during feeding periods is vital for key life history stages during migration, including mating, calving, and lactation. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between migration timing and body condition of Western Australian humpback whales. We used unmanned aerial vehicles to measure body condition (residual of body volume vs. length) in 2017 and 2021. Morphometric measurements were obtained from 460 individuals (71 calves, 83 juveniles, 235 adults, and 71 lactating females) during the northbound (toward breeding grounds) and southbound (toward feeding grounds) migration between May and November. Body condition decreased by 23 and 13 percentage points for juveniles and adults, respectively. The body condition of juveniles was shown to be correlated with migration timing for their northern migration, with individuals in better body condition migrating to the breeding grounds earlier. While stored energy is vital for humpback whales to successfully complete their vast migration to-and-from breeding grounds, we found no evidence that body condition affects the migration timing for adults, lactating females, and calves.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Russell","given":"Grace"},{"family":"Cagnazzi","given":"Daniele"},{"family":"Colefax","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Sprogis","given":"Kate R."},{"family":"Christiansen","given":"Fredrik"}],"citation-key":"russell_etal","container-title":"Marine Mammal Science","DOI":"10.1111/mms.13074","ISSN":"1748-7692","issue":"n/a","language":"en","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Cost of migration and migratory timing in Western Australian humpback whales","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mms.13074","volume":"n/a"},

Rapid aggregation of some marine fish and crustacean forage species during wind-driven coastal upwelling has recently been discovered, motivating the hypothesis that predators of these forage species track the upwelling circulation in which prey aggregation occurs. We examine this hypothesis in the central California Current Ecosystem using integrative observations of upwelling dynamics, forage species' aggregation, and blue whale movement. Directional origins of blue whale calls repeatedly tracked upwelling plume circulation when wind-driven upwelling intensified and aggregation of forage species was heightened. Our findings illustrate a resource tracking strategy by which blue whales may maximize energy gain amid ephemeral foraging opportunities. These findings have implications for the ecology and conservation of diverse predators that are sustained by forage populations whose behaviour is responsive to episodic environmental dynamics.","author":[{"family":"Ryan","given":"John P."},{"family":"Benoit-Bird","given":"Kelly J."},{"family":"Oestreich","given":"William K."},{"family":"Leary","given":"Paul R."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Kevin B."},{"literal":"Chad M.

We report the occurrence of Southeast Pacific type 2 (SEP2) calls, which exhibit peak frequencies, durations and timing consistent with previous recordings made using towed and moored hydrophones. We also describe tonal downswept (D) calls, which have not been previously described for this population. As being able to accurately assign vocalizations to individual whales is fundamental for studying communication and for estimating population densities from call rates, we further examine the feasibility of using high-resolution DTAG accelerometers to identify low-frequency calls produced by tagged blue whales. We cross-correlated acoustic signals with simultaneous tri-axial accelerometer readings in order to analyse the phase match as well as the amplitude of accelerometer signals associated with low-frequency calls, which provides a quantitative method of determining if a call is associated with a detectable acceleration signal. Our results suggest that vocalizations from nearby individuals are also capable of registering accelerometer signals in the tagged whale9s DTAG record. We cross-correlate acceleration vectors between calls to explore the possibility of using signature acceleration patterns associated with sounds produced within the tagged whale as a new method of identifying which accelerometer-detectable calls originate from the tagged animal.","author":[{"family":"Saddler","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Bocconcelli","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Hickmott","given":"Leigh S."},{"family":"Chiang","given":"Gustavo"},{"family":"Landea-Briones","given":"Rafaela"},{"family":"Bahamonde","given":"Paulina"},{"family":"Howes","given":"Gloria"},{"family":"Segre","given":"Paolo S."},{"family":"Sayigh","given":"Laela S."}],"citation-key":"saddler_etal17","container-title":"The Journal of Experimental Biology","DOI":"10.1242/jeb.151498","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,11,15]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2752666393","page":"4119-4129","title":"Characterizing Chilean blue whale vocalizations with DTAGs : a test of using tag accelerometers for caller identification","type":"article-journal","volume":"220"},

  {"id":"sanz_morgan13","abstract":"The emergence of technology has been suggested to coincide with scarcity of staple resources that led to innovations in the form of tool-assisted strategies to diversify or augment typical diets. We examined seasonal patterns of several types of tool use exhibited by a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) population residing in central Africa, to determine whether their technical skills provided access to fallback resources when preferred food items were scarce. Chimpanzees in the Goualougo Triangle exhibit a diverse repertoire of tool behaviours, many of which are exhibited throughout the year. Further, they have developed specific tool sets to overcome the issues of accessibility to particular food items. Our conclusion is that these chimpanzees use a sophisticated tool technology to cope with seasonal changes in relative food abundance and gain access to high-quality foods. Subgroup sizes were smaller in tool using contexts than other foraging contexts, suggesting that the size of the social group may not be as important in promoting complex tool traditions as the frequency and type of social interactions. Further, reports from other populations and species showed that tool use may occur more often in response to ecological opportunities and relative profitability of foraging techniques than scarcity of resources.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Sanz","given":"Crickette M."},{"family":"Morgan","given":"David B."}],"citation-key":"sanz_morgan13","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2012.0416","issue":"1630","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"page":"20120416","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Ecological and social correlates of chimpanzee tool use","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2012.0416","volume":"368"},

  {"id":"sato_etal11","abstract":"Emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri), both at sea and at an experimental dive hole, often have minimal surface periods even after performance of dives far beyond their measured 5.6min aerobic dive limit (ADL: dive duration associated with the onset of post-dive blood lactate accumulation). Accelerometer-based data loggers were attached to emperor penguins diving in these two different situations to further evaluate the capacity of these birds to perform such dives without any apparent prolonged recovery periods. Minimum surface intervals for dives as long as 10min were less than 1min at both sites. Stroke rates for dives at sea were significantly greater than those for dives at the isolated dive hole. Calculated diving air volumes at sea were variable, increased with maximum depth of dive to a depth of 250m, and decreased for deeper dives. It is hypothesized that lower air volumes for the deepest dives are the result of exhalation of air underwater. Mean maximal air volumes for deep dives at sea were approximately 83% greater than those during shallow (<50m) dives. We conclude that (a) dives beyond the 5.6min ADL do not always require prolongation of surface intervals in emperor penguins, (b) stroke rate at sea is greater than at the isolated dive hole and, therefore, a reduction in muscle stroke rate does not extend the duration of aerobic metabolism during dives at sea, and (c) a larger diving air volume facilitates performance of deep dives by increasing the total body O2 store to 68ml O2kg–1. Although increased O2 storage and cardiovascular adjustments presumably optimize aerobic metabolism during dives, enhanced anaerobic capacity and hypoxemic tolerance are also essential for longer dives. This was exemplified by a 27.6min dive, after which the bird required 6min before it stood up from a prone position, another 20min before it began to walk, and 8.4h before it dived again.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Sato","given":"K."},{"family":"Shiomi","given":"K."},{"family":"Marshall","given":"G."},{"family":"Kooyman","given":"G.

  {"id":"savoca_etal21","abstract":"Baleen whales influence their ecosystems through immense prey consumption and nutrient recycling1–3. It is difficult to accurately gauge the magnitude of their current or historic ecosystem role without measuring feeding rates and prey consumed. To date, prey consumption of the largest species has been estimated using metabolic models3–9 based on extrapolations that lack empirical validation. Here, we used tags deployed on seven baleen whale (Mysticeti) species (n = 321 tag deployments) in conjunction with acoustic measurements of prey density to calculate prey consumption at daily to annual scales from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Southern Oceans. Our results suggest that previous studies3–9 have underestimated baleen whale prey consumption by threefold or more in some ecosystems. In the Southern Ocean alone, we calculate that pre-whaling populations of mysticetes annually consumed 430 million tonnes of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), twice the current estimated total biomass of E. superba10, and more than twice the global catch of marine fisheries today11. Larger whale populations may have supported higher productivity in large marine regions through enhanced nutrient recycling: our findings suggest mysticetes recycled 1.2 × 104 tonnes iron yr−1 in the Southern Ocean before whaling compared to 1.2 × 103 tonnes iron yr−1 recycled by whales today.

  {"id":"sawyer_kauffman11","abstract":"1. Birds that migrate long distances use stopover sites to optimize fuel loads and complete migration as quickly as possible. Stopover use has been predicted to facilitate a time-minimization strategy in land migrants as well, but empirical tests have been lacking, and alternative migration strategies have not been considered. 2. We used fine-scale movement data to evaluate the ecological role of stopovers in migratory mule deer Odocoileus hemionus– a land migrant whose fitness is strongly influenced by energy intake rather than migration speed. 3. Although deer could easily complete migrations (range 18–144 km) in several days, they took an average of 3 weeks and spent 95% of that time in a series of stopover sites that had higher forage quality than movement corridors. Forage quality of stopovers increased with elevation and distance from winter range. Mule deer use of stopovers corresponded with a narrow phenological range, such that deer occupied stopovers 44 days prior to peak green-up, when forage quality was presumed to be highest. Mule deer used one stopover for every 5·3 and 6·7 km travelled during spring and autumn migrations, respectively, and used the same stopovers in consecutive years. 4. Study findings indicate that stopovers play a key role in the migration strategy of mule deer by allowing individuals to migrate in concert with plant phenology and maximize energy intake rather than speed. Our results suggest that stopover use may be more common among non-avian taxa than previously thought and, although the underlying migration strategies of temperate ungulates and birds are quite different, stopover use is important to both. 5. Exploring the role of stopovers in land migrants broadens the scope of stopover ecology and recognizes that the applied and theoretical benefits of stopover ecology need not be limited to avian taxa.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Sawyer","given":"Hall"},{"family":"Kauffman","given":"Matthew J."}],"citation-key":"sawyer_kauffman11","container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01845.x","ISSN":"1365-2656","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2011 The Authors.

  {"id":"scales_etal17","abstract":"Aim Understanding the spatial ecology of endangered species is crucial to predicting habitat use at scales relevant to conservation and management. Here, we aim to model the influence of biophysical conditions on habitat suitability for endangered fin whales Balaenoptera physalus, with a view to informing management in a heavily impacted ocean region. Location We satellite-tracked the movements of 67 fin whales through the California Current System (CCS), a dynamic eastern boundary upwelling ecosystem in the Northeast Pacific. Methods We use a multi-scale modelling framework to elucidate biophysical influences on habitat suitability for fin whales in the CCS. Using generalized additive mixed models, we quantify the influence of a suite of remotely sensed variables on broadscale patterns of occupancy and present the first year-round, high-resolution predictions of seasonal habitat suitability. Further, we model the influence of contemporaneous biophysical conditions on individual-level residence times in high-use habitat. Results We present evidence of year-round habitat suitability in the southern California Current System, robust to interannual variability, establishing that North Pacific fin whales do not follow the canonical baleen whale migration model. Within the high-use habitat in the Southern California Bight (SCB), individual-level residency in localized areas (n = 16 for >30 days; n = 4 for >6 months) was associated with warm, shallow, nearshore waters (>18°C, <500 m), with cool waters (14–15°C) occurring over complex seafloor topographies and with convergent (sub)mesoscale structures at the surface. Main Conclusions Biophysical conditions in the southern CCS generate productive foraging habitats that can support the fin whale population year-round and allow for extended periods of residency in localized areas. High-use habitats for fin whales are colocated with areas of intense human use, including international shipping routes and a major naval training range. Seasonal habitat suitability maps presented here could inform the management of anthropogenic threats to endangered baleen whales in this globally significant biodiversity hotspot.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Scales","given":"Kylie L."},{"family":"Schorr","given":"Gregory S."},{"family":"Hazen","given":"Elliott L."},{"family":"Bograd","given":"Steven J."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Peter I."},{"family":"Andrews","given":"Russel D."},{"family":"Zerbini","given":"Alexandre N."},{"family":"Falcone","given":"Erin A."}],"citation-key":"scales_etal17","container-title":"Diversity and Distributions","DOI":"10.1111/ddi.12611","ISSN":"1472-4642","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","page":"1204-1215","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Should I stay or should I go?

  {"id":"schaafsma_etal22","abstract":"Allometric relationships between body properties of animals are useful for a wide variety of purposes, such as estimation of biomass, growth, population structure, bioenergetic modelling and carbon flux studies. This study summarizes allometric relationships of zooplankton and nekton species that play major roles in polar marine food webs. Measurements were performed on 639 individuals of 15 species sampled during three expeditions in the Southern Ocean (winter and summer) and 2374 individuals of 14 species sampled during three expeditions in the Arctic Ocean (spring and summer). The information provided by this study fills current knowledge gaps on relationships between length and wet/dry mass of understudied animals, such as various gelatinous zooplankton, and of animals from understudied seasons and maturity stages, for example, for the krill Thysanoessa macrura and larval Euphausia superba caught in winter. Comparisons show that there is intra-specific variation in length–mass relationships of several species depending on season, e.g. for the amphipod Themisto libellula. To investigate the potential use of generalized regression models, comparisons between sexes, maturity stages or age classes were performed and are discussed, such as for the several krill species and T. libellula. Regression model comparisons on age classes of the fish E. antarctica were inconclusive about their general use. Other allometric measurements performed on carapaces, eyes, heads, telsons, tails and otoliths provided models that proved to be useful for estimating length or mass in, e.g. diet studies. In some cases, the suitability of these models may depend on species or developmental stages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Schaafsma","given":"Fokje L."},{"family":"David","given":"Carmen L."},{"family":"Kohlbach","given":"Doreen"},{"family":"Ehrlich","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Castellani","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Lange","given":"Benjamin A."},{"family":"Vortkamp","given":"Martina"},{"family":"Meijboom","given":"André"},{"family":"Fortuna-Wünsch","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Immerz","given":"Antonia"},{"family":"Cantzler","given":"Hannelore"},{"family":"Klasmeier","given":"Apasiri"},{"family":"Zakharova","given":"Nadezhda"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Katrin"},{"family":"Van de Putte","given":"Anton P."},{"family":"Franeker","given":"Jan Andries","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Flores","given":"Hauke"}],"citation-key":"schaafsma_etal22","container-title":"Polar Biology","container-title-short":"Polar Biol","DOI":"10.1007/s00300-021-02984-4","ISSN":"1432-2056","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"language":"en","source":"Springer Link","title":"Allometric relationships of ecologically important Antarctic and Arctic zooplankton and fish species","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00300-021-02984-4"},

  {"id":"sebens82","abstract":"A model was developed that can be used to analyze the relationship between body size of indeterminately growing animals and habitat suitability. The model states that the amount of energy available for reproduction in a given season is maximized by maximizing the difference between energy intake and energetic cost as functions of individual mass. Two problems of energy allocation to growth and reproduction are considered as different forms of the model, one where space to store energy during the season is limiting within the organism and a second where it is not. The general model predicts that optimum size will increase with habitat suitability (more prey or lower physiological stress) and that asexual reproduction (colony or clone formation) can often be more energetically favorable than growth to the largest possible individual body size. Relationships between body size, morphology, prey capture, and energetic cost were examined for a passive suspension feeder, the sea anemone Anthopleura xanthogrammica in Washington State. Prey capture was measured in the field for naturally occurring prey and for marked prey released in field experiments. Energetic cost was measured as mass loss during starvation in aquaria. Results show that: (1) prey capture depends on the surface area of the feeding structure, (2) growth isometric in this species, and (3) energetic cost increases as a higher power of mass than does prey capture. Observed patterns of size distribution and prey capture rate in the field are as predicted by the model. Larger individuals are found in habitats having more prey or lower stress. For example, Anthopleura xanthrogrammica increases in size from the high to the low intertidal. Low intertidal habitats have both more feeding time and generally lower summer temperatures and are thus more energetically suitable than those in the high intertidal.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Sebens","given":"Kenneth P."}],"citation-key":"sebens82","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.2307/1937045","ISSN":"1939-9170","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1982]]},"language":"en","page":"209-222","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Limits to Indeterminate Growth: An Optimal Size Model Applied To passive Suspension Feeders","title-short":"The Limits to Indeterminate Growth","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2307/1937045","volume":"63"},

  {"id":"segre_etal20","abstract":"The considerable power needed for large whales to leap out of the water may represent the single most expensive burst maneuver found in nature. However, the mechanics and energetic costs associated with the breaching behaviors of large whales remain poorly understood. In this study we deployed whale-borne tags to measure the kinematics of breaching to test the hypothesis that these spectacular aerial displays are metabolically expensive. We found that breaching whales use variable underwater trajectories, and that high-emergence breaches are faster and require more energy than predatory lunges. The most expensive breaches approach the upper limits of vertebrate muscle performance, and the energetic cost of breaching is high enough that repeated breaching events may serve as honest signaling of body condition. Furthermore, the confluence of muscle contractile properties, hydrodynamics, and the high speeds required likely impose an upper limit to the body size and effectiveness of breaching whales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Segre","given":"Paolo S"},{"family":"Potvin","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Cade","given":"David E"},{"family":"Calambokidis","given":"John"},{"family":"Di Clemente","given":"Jacopo"},{"family":"Fish","given":"Frank E"},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari S"},{"family":"Gough","given":"William T"},{"family":"Kahane-Rapport","given":"Shirel R"},{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Cláudia"},{"family":"Parks","given":"Susan E"},{"family":"Penry","given":"Gwenith S"},{"family":"Simon","given":"Malene"},{"family":"Stimpert","given":"Alison K"},{"family":"Wiley","given":"David N"},{"family":"Bierlich","given":"Kc"},{"family":"Madsen","given":"Peter T"},{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Jeremy A"}],"citation-key":"segre_etal20","container-title":"eLife","DOI":"10.7554/eLife.51760","ISSN":"2050-084X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","license":"All rights reserved","source":"Crossref","title":"Energetic and physical limitations on the breaching performance of large whales","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://elifesciences.org/articles/51760","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"segre_etal21","abstract":"ABSTRACT With their ability to facultatively switch between filter-feeding modes, sei whales represent a functional and ecological intermediate in the transition between intermittent and continuous filter feeding. Morphologically resembling their lunge-feeding, rorqual relatives, sei whales have convergently evolved the ability to skim prey near the surface of the water, like the more distantly related balaenids. Because of their intermediate nature, understanding how sei whales switch between feeding behaviors may shed light on the rapid evolution and flexibility of filter-feeding strategies. We deployed multi-sensor bio-logging tags on two sei whales and measured the kinematics of feeding behaviors in this poorly understood and endangered species. To forage at the surface, sei whales used a unique combination of surface lunges and skim-feeding behaviors. The surface lunges were slow and stereotyped, and were unlike lunges performed by other rorqual species. The skim-feeding events featured a different filtration mechanism from the lunges and were kinematically different from the continuous filter feeding used by balaenids. While foraging below the surface, sei whales used faster and more variable lunges. The morphological characteristics that allow sei whales to effectively perform different feeding behaviors suggest that sei whales rapidly evolved their functionally intermediate and ecologically flexible form to compete with larger and more efficient rorqual species.","author":[{"family":"Segre","given":"Paolo S."},{"family":"Weir","given":"Caroline R."},{"family":"Stanworth","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Cartwright","given":"Steve"},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari S."},{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Jeremy A."}],"citation-key":"segre_etal21","container-title":"The Journal of Experimental Biology","DOI":"10.1242/jeb.238873","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 3161030742","title":"Biomechanically distinct filter-feeding behaviors distinguish sei whales as a functional intermediate and ecologically flexible species","type":"article-journal","volume":"224"},

Using suction-cup attached bio-loggers, we identified a previously undescribed feeding behavior used by Bryde's whales to catch prey, and this behavior may make them susceptible to entanglement and mortality in bottom-mounted fishing gear. As they chase down their prey, inshore Bryde's whales sprint and maneuver along the seafloor for extended periods of time, making multiple direction changes, and reaching extraordinarily high swimming speeds. These findings assisted in the implementation of mandatory changes to octopus fishing gear that have drastically reduced the number of entanglements. The novel finding that Bryde's whales use high-speed chases near the seafloor to catch their prey highlights the value of using species-specific, behavioral information for making conservation recommendations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Segre","given":"Paolo S."},{"family":"Clemente","given":"Jacopo","non-dropping-particle":"di"},{"family":"Kahane-Rapport","given":"Shirel R."},{"family":"Gough","given":"William T."},{"family":"Meÿer","given":"Michael A."},{"family":"Lombard","given":"Amanda T."},{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Jeremy A."},{"family":"Penry","given":"Gwenith S."}],"citation-key":"segre_etal21a","container-title":"Conservation Science and Practice","DOI":"10.1111/csp2.12646","ISSN":"2578-4854","issue":"n/a","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","license":"All rights reserved","page":"e12646","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"High-speed chases along the seafloor put Bryde's whales at risk of entanglement","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/csp2.12646","volume":"n/a"},
  {"id":"segre_etal22","abstract":"Despite their enormous size, whales make their living as voracious predators. To catch their much smaller, more maneuverable prey, they have developed several unique locomotor strategies that require high energetic input, high mechanical power output and a surprising degree of agility. To better understand how body size affects maneuverability at the largest scale, we used bio-logging data, aerial photogrammetry and a high-throughput approach to quantify the maneuvering performance of seven species of free-swimming baleen whale. We found that as body size increases, absolute maneuvering performance decreases: larger whales use lower accelerations and perform slower pitch-changes, rolls and turns than smaller species. We also found that baleen whales exhibit positive allometry of maneuvering performance: relative to their body size, larger whales use higher accelerations, and perform faster pitch-changes, rolls and certain types of turns than smaller species. However, not all maneuvers were impacted by body size in the same way, and we found that larger whales behaviorally adjust for their decreased agility by using turns that they can perform more effectively. The positive allometry of maneuvering performance suggests that large whales have compensated for their increased body size by evolving more effective control surfaces and by preferentially selecting maneuvers that play to their strengths.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Segre","given":"Paolo S."},{"family":"Gough","given":"William T."},{"family":"Roualdes","given":"Edward A."},{"family":"Cade","given":"David E."},{"family":"Czapanskiy","given":"Max F."},{"family":"Fahlbusch","given":"James"},{"family":"Kahane-Rapport","given":"Shirel R."},{"family":"Oestreich","given":"William K."},{"family":"Bejder","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Bierlich","given":"K.

  {"id":"sereno_etal22","abstract":"A predominantly fish-eating diet was envisioned for the sail-backed theropod dinosaur Spinosaurus aegyptiacus when its elongate jaws with subconical teeth were unearthed a century ago in Egypt. Recent discovery of the high-spined tail of that skeleton, however, led to a bolder conjecture that S. aegyptiacus was the first fully aquatic dinosaur. The ‘aquatic hypothesis’ posits that S. aegyptiacus was a slow quadruped on land but a capable pursuit predator in coastal waters, powered by an expanded tail. We test these functional claims with skeletal and flesh models of S. aegyptiacus. We assembled a CT-based skeletal reconstruction based on the fossils, to which we added internal air and muscle to create a posable flesh model. That model shows that on land S. aegyptiacus was bipedal and in deep water was an unstable, slow-surface swimmer (<1 m/s) too buoyant to dive. Living reptiles with similar spine-supported sails over trunk and tail are used for display rather than aquatic propulsion, and nearly all extant secondary swimmers have reduced limbs and fleshy tail flukes. New fossils also show that Spinosaurus ranged far inland. Two stages are clarified in the evolution of Spinosaurus, which is best understood as a semiaquatic bipedal ambush piscivore that frequented the margins of coastal and inland waterways.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Sereno","given":"Paul C"},{"family":"Myhrvold","given":"Nathan"},{"family":"Henderson","given":"Donald M"},{"family":"Fish","given":"Frank E"},{"family":"Vidal","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Baumgart","given":"Stephanie L"},{"family":"Keillor","given":"Tyler M"},{"family":"Formoso","given":"Kiersten K"},{"family":"Conroy","given":"Lauren L"}],"citation-key":"sereno_etal22","container-title":"eLife","DOI":"10.7554/eLife.80092","editor":[{"family":"Zhu","given":"Min"},{"family":"Rutz","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Min"},{"family":"Holtz","given":"Thomas R"},{"family":"Hone","given":"David"}],"ISSN":"2050-084X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"page":"e80092","publisher":"eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd","source":"eLife","title":"Spinosaurus is not an aquatic dinosaur","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.80092","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"shadwick_etal13","abstract":"Muscle serves a wide variety of mechanical functions during animal feeding and locomotion, but the performance of this tissue is limited by how far it can be extended. In rorqual whales, feeding and locomotion are integrated in a dynamic process called lunge feeding, where an enormous volume of prey-laden water is engulfed into a capacious ventral oropharyngeal cavity that is bounded superficially by skeletal muscle and ventral groove blubber (VGB). The great expansion of the cavity wall presents a mechanical challenge for the physiological limits of skeletal muscle, yet its role is considered fundamental in controlling the flux of water into the mouth. Our analyses of the functional properties and mechanical behaviour of VGB muscles revealed a crimped microstructure in an unstrained, non-feeding state that is arranged in parallel with dense and straight elastin fibres. This allows the muscles to accommodate large tissue deformations of the VGB yet still operate within the known strain limits of vertebrate skeletal muscle. VGB transverse strains in routine-feeding rorquals were substantially less than those observed in dead ones, where decomposition gas stretched the VGB to its elastic limit, evidence supporting the idea that eccentric muscle contraction modulates the rate of expansion and ultimate size of the ventral cavity during engulfment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Shadwick","given":"R.

Tracks (262 ± 23 days) reveal that shearwaters fly across the entire Pacific Ocean in a figure-eight pattern while traveling 64,037 ± 9,779 km roundtrip, the longest animal migration ever recorded electronically. Each shearwater made a prolonged stopover in one of three discrete regions off Japan, Alaska, or California before returning to New Zealand through a relatively narrow corridor in the central Pacific Ocean. Transit rates as high as 910 ± 186 km·day−1 were recorded, and shearwaters accessed prey resources in both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere’s most productive waters from the surface to 68.2 m depth. Our results indicate that sooty shearwaters integrate oceanic resources throughout the Pacific Basin on a yearly scale.

We conducted a series of laboratory experiments to gain insight into the effect of bubbles on the Pacific herring, Clupea harengus pallasi, a principal prey species of the humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae. The fish exhibited strong avoidance of bubbles and could be contained within a circular bubble net. The herring schools were also reluctant to swim through a curtain of bubbles even when frightened. However, herring were much more willing to cross a bubble curtain or net if there was a larger aggregation of fish on the opposite side. Individuals and small groups of herring also waited for less time before crossing than did larger groups.

We collected and examined ~57 h of data from five bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Day-scale changes in behavior and activity level were observed and diurnal changes were detected with lower activity at night (n = 1). During the day, animals spent about 70% of their time swimming. The deepest part of the lagoon is ~3 m and individual dives were typically shallow (~1 m) with the dolphins tending to utilize a fluke and glide gait pattern. Activity level was quantified using overall dynamic body acceleration. A significant relationship between normalized activity level and glide duration during different portions of the dive was measured; animals fluked more during descent and glided more during ascent. This could indicate that even during very shallow dives the dolphins use their positive buoyancy to improve energy economy.","author":[{"family":"Shorter","given":"K.

  {"id":"shuert_etal20","abstract":"Abstract Animal-borne telemetry devices have become a popular and valuable means for studying the cryptic lives of cetaceans. Evaluating the effect of capture, handling and tagging procedures remains largely unassessed across species. Here, we examine the effect of capture, handling and tagging activities on an iconic Arctic cetacean, the narwhal (Monodon monoceros), which has previously been shown to exhibit an extreme response to extended capture and handling. Using accelerometry-derived metrics of behaviour, including activity level, energy expenditure and swimming activity, we quantify the post-release responses and time to recovery of 19 individuals following capture and tagging activities considering the intrinsic covariates of sex and individual size and the extrinsic covariates of handling time and presence of a ‘bolt-on’ satellite telemetry device. From accelerometer-derived behaviour, most narwhals appeared to return to mean baseline behaviour (recovery) within 24 hours after release, which was supported by longer-term measures of diving data. None of the covariates measured, however, had an effect on the time individuals took to recover following release. Using generalized additive models to describe changes in behaviour over time, we found handling time to be a significant predictor of activity levels, energy expenditure and swimming behaviour following release. Individuals held for the longest period (&amp;gt;40 min) were found to display the largest effect in behaviour immediately following release with respect to swimming behaviour and activity levels. We also found some support for relationships between activity levels, energy expenditure and swimming activity and two other covariates: sex and the attachment of a bolt-on configuration satellite tags. Our results indicate that narwhals recover relatively quickly following capture, handling and tagging procedures, but we suggest that researchers should minimize handling time and further investigation is needed on how to mitigate potential effects of bolt-on satellite tags in these sensitive species.","author":[{"family":"Shuert","given":"Courtney R"},{"family":"Marcoux","given":"Marianne"},{"family":"Hussey","given":"Nigel E."},{"family":"Watt","given":"Cortney A."},{"family":"Auger-Méthé","given":"Marie"}],"citation-key":"shuert_etal20","container-title":"Conservation Physiology","DOI":"10.1093/conphys/coaa128","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"note":"MAG ID: 3118751692","title":"Assessing the post-release effects of capture, handling and placement of satellite telemetry devices on narwhal (Monodon monoceros) movement behaviour.","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"sibly_brown07","abstract":"It has recently been proposed that life-history evolution is subject to a fundamental size-dependent constraint. This constraint limits the rate at which biomass can be produced so that production per unit of body mass is inevitably slower in larger organisms than in smaller ones. Here we derive predictions for how changes in body size and production rates evolve in different lifestyles subject to this constraint. Predictions are tested by using data on the mass of neonate tissue produced per adult per year in 637 placental mammal species and are generally supported. Compared with terrestrial insectivores with generalized primitive traits, mammals that have evolved more specialized lifestyles have divergent mass-specific production rates: (i) increased in groups that specialize on abundant and reliable foods: grazing and browsing herbivores (artiodactyls, lagomorphs, perissodactyls, and folivorous rodents) and flesh-eating marine mammals (pinnipeds, cetaceans); and (ii) decreased in groups that have lifestyles with reduced death rates: bats, primates, arboreal, fossorial, and desert rodents, bears, elephants, and rhinos. Convergent evolution of groups with similar lifestyles is common, so patterns of productivity across mammalian taxa reflect both ecology and phylogeny. The overall result is that groups with different lifestyles have parallel but offset relationships between production rate and body size. These results shed light on the evolution of the fast–slow life-history continuum, suggesting that variation occurs along two axes corresponding to body size and lifestyle.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Sibly","given":"Richard M."},{"family":"Brown","given":"James H."}],"citation-key":"sibly_brown07","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0707725104","issue":"45","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,11,6]]},"page":"17707-17712","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"pnas.org (Atypon)","title":"Effects of body size and lifestyle on evolution of mammal life histories","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0707725104","volume":"104"},
  {"id":"silva_etal13","abstract":"The need to balance energy reserves during migration is a critical factor for most long-distance migrants and an important determinant of migratory strategies in birds, insects and land mammals. Large baleen whales migrate annually between foraging and breeding sites, crossing vast ocean areas where food is seldom abundant. How whales respond to the demands and constraints of such long migrations remains unknown. We applied a behaviour discriminating hierarchical state-space model to the satellite tracking data of 12 fin whales and 3 blue whales tagged off the Azores, to investigate their movements, behaviour (transiting and area-restricted search, ARS) and daily activity cycles during the spring migration. Fin and blue whales remained at middle latitudes for prolonged periods, spending most of their time there in ARS behaviour. While near the Azores, fin whale ARS behaviour occurred within a restricted area, with a high degree of overlap among whales. There were noticeable behavioural differences along the migratory pathway of fin whales tracked to higher latitudes: ARS occurred only in the Azores and north of 56°N, whereas in between these areas whales travelled at higher overall speeds while maintaining a nearly direct trajectory. This suggests fin whales may alternate periods of active migration with periods of extended use of specific habitats along the migratory route. ARS behaviour in blue whales occurred over a much wider area as whales slowly progressed northwards. The tracks of these whales terminated still at middle latitudes, before any behavioural switch was detected. Fin whales exhibited behavioural-specific diel rhythms in swimming speed but these varied significantly between geographic areas, possibly due to differences in the day-night cycle across areas. Finally, we show a link between fin whales seen in the Azores and those summering in eastern Greenland-western Iceland along a migratory corridor located in central Atlantic waters.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Silva","given":"Mónica A."},{"family":"Prieto","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Jonsen","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Baumgartner","given":"Mark F."},{"family":"Santos","given":"Ricardo S."}],"citation-key":"silva_etal13","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0076507","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","page":"e76507","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"North Atlantic Blue and Fin Whales Suspend Their Spring Migration to Forage in Middle Latitudes: Building up Energy Reserves for the Journey?","title-short":"North Atlantic Blue and Fin Whales Suspend Their Spring Migration to Forage in Middle Latitudes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0076507","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"silva_etal14","abstract":"Argos recently implemented a new algorithm to calculate locations of satellite-tracked animals that uses a Kalman filter (KF). The KF algorithm is reported to increase the number and accuracy of estimated positions over the traditional Least Squares (LS) algorithm, with potential advantages to the application of state-space methods to model animal movement data. We tested the performance of two Bayesian state-space models (SSMs) fitted to satellite tracking data processed with KF algorithm. Tracks from 7 harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) tagged with ARGOS satellite transmitters equipped with Fastloc GPS loggers were used to calculate the error of locations estimated from SSMs fitted to KF and LS data, by comparing those to “true” GPS locations. Data on 6 fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) were used to investigate consistency in movement parameters, location and behavioural states estimated by switching state-space models (SSSM) fitted to data derived from KF and LS methods. The model fit to KF locations improved the accuracy of seal trips by 27% over the LS model. 82% of locations predicted from the KF model and 73% of locations from the LS model were <5 km from the corresponding interpolated GPS position. Uncertainty in KF model estimates (5.6±5.6 km) was nearly half that of LS estimates (11.6±8.4 km). Accuracy of KF and LS modelled locations was sensitive to precision but not to observation frequency or temporal resolution of raw Argos data. On average, 88% of whale locations estimated by KF models fell within the 95% probability ellipse of paired locations from LS models. Precision of KF locations for whales was generally higher. Whales’ behavioural mode inferred by KF models matched the classification from LS models in 94% of the cases. State-space models fit to KF data can improve spatial accuracy of location estimates over LS models and produce equally reliable behavioural estimates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Silva","given":"Mónica A."},{"family":"Jonsen","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Russell","given":"Deborah J.

For each tagged animal, the number of whistles, foraging buzzes, dive profiles, and dive statistics were calculated. Start, end, minimum, and maximum frequencies, number of inflection points and duration were measured from 746 whistles. Whistles ranged in frequency from 9.7 ± 2.8 to 19.8 ± 4.2 kHz, had a mean duration of 0.7 ± 0.5 s and a mean of 1.2 ± 1.2 inflection points. Thirteen foraging buzzes were recorded across all tags. Mean dive depth and duration were 16 ± 9 m and 1.9 ± 1.0 min, respectively. Tagged animals spent the majority of time in the upper 10 m (76.9% ± 16.1%) of the water column. Both whistle frequency characteristics and dive statistics measured here were similar to previously reported values for spotted dolphins in Hawai‘i. Shallow, short dive profiles combined with few foraging buzzes provide evidence that little spotted dolphin feeding behavior occurs during daytime hours.

  {"id":"simon_etal12","abstract":"Rorqual baleen whales lunge feed by engulfment of tons of prey-laden water in a large and expandable buccal pouch. According to prior interpretations, feeding rorquals are brought to a near-halt at the end of each lunge by drag forces primarily generated by the open mouth. Accelerating the body from a standstill is energetically costly and is purported to be the key factor determining oxygen consumption in lunge-feeding rorquals, explaining the shorter dive times than expected given their sizes. Here, we use multi-sensor archival tags (DTAGs) sampling at high rates in a fine-scale kinematic study of lunge feeding to examine the sequence of events within lunges and how energy may be expended and conserved in the process of prey capture. Analysis of 479 lunges from five humpback whales reveals that the whales accelerate as they acquire prey, opening their gape in synchrony with strong fluke strokes. The high forward speed (mean depth rate: 2.0±0.32ms–1) during engulfment serves both to corral active prey and to expand the ventral margin of the buccal pouch and so maximize the engulfed water volume. Deceleration begins after mouth opening when the pouch nears full expansion and momentum starts to be transferred to the engulfed water. Lunge-feeding humpback whales time fluke strokes throughout the lunge to impart momentum to the engulfed water mass and so avoid a near or complete stop, but instead continue to glide at ~1–1.5ms–1 after the lunge has ended. Subsequent filtration and prey handling appear to take an average of 46s and are performed in parallel with re-positioning for the next lunge.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Simon","given":"M."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"M."},{"family":"Madsen","given":"P.

  {"id":"sims_etal05","abstract":"1 Megaplanktivores such as filter-feeding sharks and baleen whales are at the apex of a short food chain (phytoplankton–zooplankton–vertebrate) and are sensitive indicators of sea-surface plankton availability. Even though they spend the majority of their time below the surface it is still not known how most of these species utilize vertical habitat and adapt to short-term changes in food availability. 2 A key factor likely to control vertical habitat selection by planktivorous sharks is the diel vertical migration (DVM) of zooplankton; however, no study has determined whether specific ocean-habitat type influences their behavioural strategy. Based on the first high-resolution dive data collected for a plankton-feeding fish species we show that DVM patterns of the basking shark Cetorhinus maximus reflect habitat type and zooplankton behaviour. 3 In deep, well-stratified waters sharks exhibited normal DVM (dusk ascent–dawn descent) by tracking migrating sound-scattering layers characterized by Calanus and euphausiids. Sharks occupying shallow, inner-shelf areas near thermal fronts conducted reverse DVM (dusk descent–dawn ascent) possibly due to zooplankton predator–prey interactions that resulted in reverse DVM of Calanus. 4 These opposite DVM patterns resulted in the probability of daytime-surface sighting differing between these habitats by as much as two orders of magnitude. Ship-borne surveys undertaken at the same time as trackings reflected these behavioural differences. 5 The tendency of basking sharks to feed or rest for long periods at the surface has made them vulnerable to harpoon fisheries. Ship-borne and aerial surveys also use surface occurrence to assess distribution and abundance for conservation purposes. Our study indicates that without bias reduction for habitat-specific DVM patterns, current surveys could under- or overestimate shark abundance by at least 10-fold.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Sims","given":"David W."},{"family":"Southall","given":"Emily J."},{"family":"Tarling","given":"Geraint A."},{"family":"Metcalfe","given":"Julian D."}],"citation-key":"sims_etal05","container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2656.2005.00971.x","ISSN":"1365-2656","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005]]},"language":"en","page":"755-761","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Habitat-specific normal and reverse diel vertical migration in the plankton-feeding basking shark","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2005.00971.x","volume":"74"},

Sharks were tracked for between 1.8 and 55 min with between 4 and 21 mean speed determinations per shark track. The mean filter-feeding swimming speed was 0.85 m s−1 (±0.05 S.E., n=49 determinations) compared to the non-feeding (cruising) mean speed of 1.08 m s−1 (±0.03 S.E., n=21 determinations). Both absolute (m s−1) and specific (L s−1) swimming speeds during filter-feeding were significantly lower than when cruise swimming with the mouth closed, indicating basking sharks select speeds approximately 24% lower when engaged in filter-feeding. This reduction in speed during filter-feeding could be a behavioural response to avoid increased drag-induced energy costs associated with feeding at higher speeds. Non-feeding basking sharks (4 m LT) cruised at speeds close to, but slightly faster (∼18%) than the optimum speed predicted by the Weihs (1977) [Weihs, D., 1977.

Ship approaches without sonar transmis-sions, playbacks of killer whale vocalizations, and broadband noise were conducted as controls. Behavioural parameters such as horizontal movement, diving, social interactions, and vocalizations were recorded by animal-attached tags and by visual and acoustic tracking. Based on these data, two expert panels independently scored the severity of behavioural changes that were judged likely to be responses to the experimental stimuli, using a severity scale ranging from no effect (0) to high potential to affect vital rates (9) if exposed repeatedly. After scoring, consensus was reached with a third-party moderator. In humpback whales, killer whale playbacks induced more severe responses than sonar exposure, and both sonar exposures and killer whale playbacks induced more responses and responses of higher severity than the no-sonar ship approaches and broadband noise playbacks. The most common response during sonar exposures in all three species was avoidance of the sound source. The most severe responses to sonar (severity 8) were progressive high-speed avoidance by the minke whale and long-term area avoidance by the bottlenose whale. Other severe responses included prolonged avoidance and cessation of feeding (severity 7). The minke whale and bottlenose whale started avoiding the source at a received sound pressure level (SPL) of 146 and 130 dB re 1 μPa, respectively. Humpback whales generally had less severe responses that were triggered at higher received levels. The probability of severity scores with the potential to affect vital rates increased with increasing sound exposure level (SEL).

We examined the lunge-feeding behaviour of humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae before, during and after controlled exposure experiments with naval sonar by use of acoustic and motion sensor archival tags attached to each animal. Lunge-feeding by humpback whales entails a strong acceleration to increase speed before engulfing a large volume of prey-laden water, which can be identified by an acoustic signature characterized by a few seconds of high-level flow-noise followed by a rapid reduction, coinciding with a peak in animal acceleration. Over 2 successive seasons, 13 humpback whales were tagged. All were subject to a no-sonar control exposure, and 12 whales were exposed to 2 consecutive sonar exposure sessions, with 1 h between sessions. The first sonar session resulted in an average 68% reduction in lunge rate during exposure compared to pre-exposure, and this reduction was significantly greater than any changes observed during the no-sonar control. During the second sonar session, reduction in lunge rate was 66% during sonar exposure compared to the pre-exposure level, but was not significant compared to the no-sonar control, likely due to a larger inter-individual variability because some individuals appeared to have habituated whereas others had not.

  {"id":"sokolova_etal12","abstract":"Energy balance is a fundamental requirement of stress adaptation and tolerance. We explore the links between metabolism, energy balance and stress tolerance using aquatic invertebrates as an example and demonstrate that using key parameters of energy balance (aerobic scope for growth, reproduction and activity; tissue energy status; metabolic rate depression; and compensatory onset of anaerobiosis) can assist in integrating the effects of multiple stressors and their interactions and in predicting the whole-organism and population-level consequences of environmental stress. We argue that limitations of both the amount of available energy and the rates of its acquisition and metabolic conversions result in trade-offs between basal maintenance of a stressed organism and energy costs of fitness-related functions such as reproduction, development and growth and can set limit to the tolerance of a broad range of environmental stressors. The degree of stress-induced disturbance of energy balance delineates transition from moderate stress compatible with population persistence (pejus range) to extreme stress where only time-limited existence is possible (pessimum range). It also determines the predominant adaptive strategy of metabolic responses (energy compensation vs. conservation) that allows an organism to survive the disturbance. We propose that energy-related biomarkers can be used to determine the conditions when these metabolic transitions occur and thus predict ecological consequences of stress exposures. Bioenergetic considerations can also provide common denominator for integrating stress responses and predicting tolerance limits under the environmentally realistic scenarios when multiple and often variable stressors act simultaneously on an organism. Determination of bioenergetic sustainability at the organism's level (or lack thereof) has practical implications. It can help identify the habitats and/or conditions where a population can survive (even if at the cost of reduced reproduction and growth) and those that are incapable of supporting viable populations. Such an approach will assist in explaining and predicting the species' distribution limits in the face of the environmental change and informing the conservation efforts and resource management practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Sokolova","given":"Inna M."},{"family":"Frederich","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Bagwe","given":"Rita"},{"family":"Lannig","given":"Gisela"},{"family":"Sukhotin","given":"Alexey A."}],"citation-key":"sokolova_etal12","container-title":"Marine Environmental Research","container-title-short":"Marine Environmental Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.marenvres.2012.04.003","ISSN":"0141-1136","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","page":"1-15","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Energy homeostasis as an integrative tool for assessing limits of environmental stress tolerance in aquatic invertebrates","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141113612000712","volume":"79"},

We evaluated the geospatial overlap of GoM Bryde’s whales with 2 industries known to impact baleen whale species: commercial shipping and commercial fisheries. We further evaluated the potential for impacts by examining the first dive behavior data collected from a kinematic tag attached to a GoM Bryde’s whale for 3 d.

The tagged whale exhibited diel diving behavior with diurnal deep dives and foraging lunges at or near the sea floor, and shallow nocturnal diving, with 88% of its nighttime spent near the surface within the draught depths of most large commercial vessels. Given the location of commercial shipping traffic in GoM Bryde’s whale habitat, ship strikes may pose a threat to this population if the whales commonly spend time near the surface, especially at night. Also, if bottom or near-bottom feeding is a normal feeding strategy for these whales, there is potential for entanglement in bottom longline gear. Managing these threats may improve population recovery.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Soldevilla","given":"Ms"},{"family":"Hildebrand","given":"Ja"},{"family":"Frasier","given":"Ke"},{"family":"Aichinger Dias","given":"L"},{"family":"Martinez","given":"A"},{"family":"Mullin","given":"Kd"},{"family":"Rosel","given":"Pe"},{"family":"Garrison","given":"Lp"}],"citation-key":"soldevilla_etal17","container-title":"Endangered Species Research","container-title-short":"Endang.

Many such movements are energetically costly yet there is little consensus on whether or how such costs might influence schedules of survival and reproduction in migratory animals. Here we provide a global analysis of associations between migratory behaviour and vertebrate life histories. After controlling for latitudinal and evolutionary patterns, we find that migratory birds and mammals have faster paces of life than their non-migratory relatives. Among swimming and walking species, migrants tend to have larger body size, while among flying species, migrants are smaller. We discuss whether pace of life is a determinant, consequence, or adaptive outcome, of migration.

These studies are being enabled and enhanced by advances in both acoustic sensing and transmission technologies. In the design of a 5-year project in southern California (SOCAL-BRS) the development of a compact, hand-deployable, ship-powered, 15-element vertical line array sound source enabled a fundamental change in overall project configuration from earlier efforts. The reduced size and power requirements of the sound source, which achieved relatively high output levels and directivity characteristics specified in the experimental design, enabled the use of substantially smaller research vessels. This size reduction favored a decentralization of field effort, with greater emphasis on mobile small boat operations capable of covering large areas to locate and tag marine mammals. These changes in configuration directly contributed to significant increases in tagging focal animals and conducting sound exposure experiments. During field experiments, received sound levels on tagged animals of several different species were within specified target ranges, demonstrating the efficacy of these new solutions to challenging field research problems.","author":[{"family":"Southall","given":"Brandon L."},{"family":"Moretti","given":"David"},{"family":"Abraham","given":"Bruce"},{"family":"Calambokidis","given":"John"},{"family":"DeRuiter","given":"Stacy L."},{"family":"Tyack","given":"Peter L."}],"citation-key":"southall_etal12","container-title":"Marine Technology Society Journal","DOI":"10.4031/mtsj.46.4.1","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,7,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2025641907","page":"48-59","title":"Marine Mammal Behavioral Response Studies in Southern California: Advances in Technology and Experimental Methods","type":"article-journal","volume":"46"},
  {"id":"southall_etal16","abstract":"Substantial recent progress has been made in directly measuring behavioral responses of free-ranging marine mammals to sound using controlled exposure experiments. Many studies were motivated by concerns about observed and potential negative effects of military sonar, including stranding events. Well-established experimental methods and increasingly sophisticated technologies have enabled fine-resolution measurement of many aspects of baseline behavior and responses to sonar. Studies have considered increasingly diverse taxa, but primarily odontocete and mysticete cetaceans that are endangered, particularly sensitive, or frequently exposed to sonar. This review focuses on recent field experiments studying cetacean responses to simulated or actual active military sonars in the 1 to 8 kHz band. Overall results demonstrate that some individuals of different species display clear yet varied responses, some of which have negative implications, while others appear to tolerate relatively high levels, although such exposures may have other consequences not measured. Responses were highly variable and may not be fully predictable with simple acoustic exposure metrics (e.g. received sound level). Rather, differences among species and individuals along with contextual aspects of exposure (e.g. behavioral state) appear to affect response probability. These controlled experiments provide critically needed documentation of identified behavioral responses occurring upon known sonar exposures, and they directly inform regulatory assessments of potential effects. They also inform more targeted opportunistic monitoring of potential responses of animals during sonar operations and have stimulated adaptations of field methods to consider increasingly realistic exposure scenarios and how contextual factors such as behavioral state and source proximity influence response type and probability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Southall","given":"Brandon L."},{"family":"Nowacek","given":"Douglas P."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Patrick J.

  {"id":"southall_etal19","abstract":"ABSTRACT  This study measured the degree of behavioral responses in blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) to controlled noise exposure off the southern California coast. High-resolution movement and passive acoustic data were obtained from non-invasive archival tags (n=42) whereas surface positions were obtained with visual focal follows. Controlled exposure experiments (CEEs) were used to obtain direct behavioral measurements before, during and after simulated and operational military mid-frequency active sonar (MFAS), pseudorandom noise (PRN) and controls (no noise exposure). For a subset of deep-feeding animals (n=21), active acoustic measurements of prey were obtained and used as contextual covariates in response analyses. To investigate potential behavioral changes within individuals as a function of controlled noise exposure conditions, two parallel analyses of time-series data for selected behavioral parameters (e.g. diving, horizontal movement and feeding) were conducted. This included expert scoring of responses according to a specified behavioral severity rating paradigm and quantitative change-point analyses using Mahalanobis distance statistics. Both methods identified clear changes in some conditions. More than 50% of blue whales in deep-feeding states responded during CEEs, whereas no changes in behavior were identified in shallow-feeding blue whales. Overall, responses were generally brief, of low to moderate severity, and highly dependent on exposure context such as behavioral state, source-to-whale horizontal range and prey availability. Response probability did not follow a simple exposure–response model based on received exposure level. These results, in combination with additional analytical methods to investigate different aspects of potential responses within and among individuals, provide a comprehensive evaluation of how free-ranging blue whales responded to mid-frequency military sonar.","author":[{"family":"Southall","given":"Brandon L."},{"family":"DeRuiter","given":"Stacy L."},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari S."},{"family":"Stimpert","given":"Alison K."},{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Jeremy A."},{"family":"Hazen","given":"Elliott L."},{"family":"Casey","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Fregosi","given":"Selene"},{"family":"Cade","given":"David E."},{"family":"Allen","given":"Ann N."},{"family":"Harris","given":"Catriona M."},{"family":"Schorr","given":"Greg"},{"family":"Moretti","given":"David"},{"family":"Guan","given":"Shane"},{"family":"Calambokidis","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"southall_etal19","container-title":"The Journal of Experimental Biology","DOI":"10.1242/jeb.190637","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2918486904","PMID":"30833464","title":"Behavioral responses of individual blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) to mid-frequency military sonar.","type":"article-journal","volume":"222"},

Considering the transport and support function of the metabolicallyinert structures and their interconnections it is likely that the infrastructure will basically show some tree-like, branching building plan. The weight of the metabolicallyinert infrastructure of an organism, can be given by bW/(e+W), in which W = body weight, b and c areconstants.

  {"id":"speakman05","abstract":"Bigger animals live longer. The scaling exponent for the relationship between lifespan and body mass is between 0.15 and 0.3. Bigger animals also expend more energy, and the scaling exponent for the relationship of resting metabolic rate (RMR) to body mass lies somewhere between 0.66 and 0.8. Mass-specific RMR therefore scales with a corresponding exponent between -0.2 and -0.33. Because the exponents for mass-specific RMR are close to the exponents for lifespan, but have opposite signs, their product (the mass-specific expenditure of energy per lifespan) is independent of body mass(exponent between -0.08 and 0.08). This means that across species a gram of tissue on average expends about the same amount of energy before it dies regardless of whether that tissue is located in a shrew, a cow, an elephant or a whale. This fact led to the notion that ageing and lifespan are processes regulated by energy metabolism rates and that elevating metabolism will be associated with premature mortality - the rate of living theory.The free-radical theory of ageing provides a potential mechanism that links metabolism to ageing phenomena, since oxygen free radicals are formed as a by-product of oxidative phosphorylation. Despite this potential synergy in these theoretical approaches, the free-radical theory has grown in stature while the rate of living theory has fallen into disrepute. This is primarily because comparisons made across classes (for example, between birds and mammals) do not conform to the expectations, and even within classes there is substantial interspecific variability in the mass-specific expenditure of energy per lifespan. Using interspecific data to test the rate of living hypothesis is, however, confused by several major problems. For example,appeals that the resultant lifetime expenditure of energy per gram of tissue is `too variable' depend on the biological significance rather than the statistical significance of the variation observed. Moreover, maximum lifespan is not a good marker of ageing and RMR is not a good measure of total energy metabolism. Analysis of residual lifespan against residual RMR reveals no significant relationship. However, this is still based on RMR.A novel comparison using daily energy expenditure (DEE), rather than BMR,suggests that lifetime expenditure of energy per gram of tissue is NOT independent of body mass, and that tissue in smaller animals expends more energy before expiring than tissue in larger animals. Some of the residual variation in this relationship in mammals is explained by ambient temperature. In addition there is a significant negative relationship between residual lifespan and residual daily energy expenditure in mammals. A potentially much better model to explore the links of body size, metabolism and ageing is to examine the intraspecific links. These studies have generated some data that support the original rate of living theory and other data that conflict. In particular several studies have shown that manipulating animals to expend more or less energy generate the expected effects on lifespan (particularly when the subjects are ectotherms). However, smaller individuals with higher rates of metabolism live longer than their slower, larger conspecifics.An addition to these confused observations has been the recent suggestion that under some circumstances we might expect mitochondria to produce fewer free radicals when metabolism is higher - particularly when they are uncoupled. These new ideas concerning the manner in which mitochondria generate free radicals as a function of metabolism shed some light on the complexity of observations linking body size, metabolism and lifespan.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Speakman","given":"John R."}],"citation-key":"speakman05","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Biology","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Biology","DOI":"10.1242/jeb.01556","ISSN":"0022-0949","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,5,1]]},"page":"1717-1730","source":"Silverchair","title":"Body size, energy metabolism and lifespan","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.01556","volume":"208"},

  {"id":"stephens_etal09","abstract":"The life histories of organisms can show pronounced variation in the way that the costs of reproduction are financed. To facilitate discussions of this variation, two terms are increasing in use: “capital breeding” describes the situation in which reproduction is financed using stored capital; “income breeding” refers to the use of concurrent intake to pay for a reproductive attempt. We consider the value of the capital and income typology with reference to three functions that it might serve: description, explanation, and prediction. We find that interpretations of the terms have diversified and lack rigidity, leading to subjectivity in their definition. We recognize that time frames of interest will vary among taxa, but we urge consistency of use within those taxa. We also urge consistency in the use of a single metric designed to measure the reliance of an organism on capital. The concepts of capital and income breeding have served well as proximate explanations for behavioral or physiological diversity, but efforts to explain their adaptive value have been disproportionately focused on individual taxa. Mapping cause to effect is difficult in ecology. Nevertheless, further analyses, based on consistently applied measures of reliance on stored capital, may reveal which of the putative ecological, morphological, and physiological drivers have the most consistent and widespread effects. The capital–income typology has yet to be applied to the question of prediction, and thus, it remains to be seen whether these concepts will be of use in identifying the likely responses of different populations to changes in their environment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Stephens","given":"Philip A."},{"family":"Boyd","given":"Ian L."},{"family":"McNamara","given":"John M."},{"family":"Houston","given":"Alasdair I."}],"citation-key":"stephens_etal09","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1890/08-1369.1","ISSN":"1939-9170","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"en","page":"2057-2067","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Capital breeding and income breeding: their meaning, measurement, and worth","title-short":"Capital breeding and income breeding","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/08-1369.1","volume":"90"},

In the past decade, human-caused mortalities from vessel strikes and entanglements have been increasing, while birth rates in the population are at a 40 yr low. In addition to declining abundance, recent studies have shown that NARW length-at-age is decreasing due to the energetic impacts of sub-lethal entanglements, and that the body condition of the population is poorer than closely related southern right whales. We examined whether shorter body lengths are associated with reduced fecundity in female NARW. We compared age-corrected, modeled metrics of body length with 3 metrics of fecundity: age at first reproduction, average inter-birth interval, and the number of calves produced per potential reproductive year. We found that body length is significantly related to birth interval and calves produced per reproductive year, but not age at first reproduction. Larger whales had shorter inter-birth intervals and produced more calves per potential reproductive year. Larger whales also had higher lifetime calf production, but this was a result of larger whales having longer potential reproductive spans, as body lengths have generally been declining over the past 40 yr. Declining body sizes are a potential contributor to low birth rates over the past decade. Efforts to reduce entanglements and vessel strikes could help maintain population viability by increasing fecundity and improving resiliency of the population to other anthropogenic and climate impacts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Stewart","given":"Joshua D."},{"family":"Durban","given":"John W."},{"family":"Europe","given":"Hollis"},{"family":"Fearnbach","given":"Holly"},{"family":"Hamilton","given":"Philip K."},{"family":"Knowlton","given":"Amy R."},{"family":"Lynn","given":"Morgan S."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Carolyn A."},{"family":"Perryman","given":"Wayne L."},{"family":"Tao","given":"Brandon W.

Here, ten humpback whales in the Western Antarctic Peninsula were tagged in May 2010 with non-invasive, suction-cup attached tags to study foraging ecology and acoustic behavior. Background song was identified on all ten records, but additionally, acoustic records of two whales showed intense and continuous singing, with a level of organization and structure approaching that of typical breeding ground song. The songs, produced either by the tagged animals or close associates, shared phrase types and theme structure with one another, and some song bouts lasted close to an hour. Dive behavior of tagged animals during the time of sound production showed song occurring during periods of active diving, sometimes to depths greater than 100 m. One tag record also contained song in the presence of feeding lunges identified from the behavioral sensors, indicating that mating displays occur in areas worthy of foraging. These data show behavioral flexibility as the humpbacks manage competing needs to continue to feed and to prepare for the breeding season during late fall. This may also signify an ability to engage in breeding activities outside of the traditional, warm water breeding ground locations.","author":[{"family":"Stimpert","given":"Alison K."},{"family":"Peavey","given":"Lindsey E."},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari S."},{"family":"Nowacek","given":"Douglas P."}],"citation-key":"stimpert_etal12","container-title":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0051214","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,12,19]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2037496439","PMCID":"3526533","PMID":"23284666","title":"Humpback Whale Song and Foraging Behavior on an Antarctic Feeding Ground","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"stimpert_etal12a","abstract":"Despite the importance of young animals to the proliferation of a species, logistic hur- dles often prevent the study of individuals' behavior and habitat requirements. This is particularly an issue in the case of cetaceans, which spend a large proportion of their time at depth. We con- ducted a study to describe the dive behavior of young humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae calves on their breeding grounds in Hawaii, USA. We first implemented and evaluated strategies for approaching whale groups and deploying suction-cup tags (DTAGs), resulting in 3 successful attachments of DTAGs in the winter of 2011. The approach technique that was most successful while minimizing reactions from the whale groups was a passive drift approach. Tagged calves exhibited consistent dives to shallow depths when their groups were stationary, and some deeper dives that approached the ocean bottom, up to 78 m in one case. Mean dive durations ranged from 2.2 to 3.5 min, with calves spending 40% of their time within 3 m of the surface. This is the first study to collect tag data from baleen whale calves less than 6 mo in age and provides habitat use data important for management of this endangered species.","author":[{"family":"Stimpert","given":"Alison K."},{"family":"Mattila","given":"David K."},{"family":"Nosal","given":"Eva-Marie"},{"family":"Au","given":"Whitlow W.

  {"id":"stimpert_etal15","abstract":"Background: For marine animals, acoustic communication is critical for many life functions, yet individual calling behavior is poorly understood for most large whale species. These topics are important for understanding whale social behavior and can also serve as a baseline for behavioral studies assessing whale response to disturbance. Using a new technique for identifying the calling individual, we measured body orientation, dive behavior, and surface social behavior in relation to call production for tagged fin whales in Southern California. Results: Behavioral metrics associated with elevated call rates included shallow maximum dive depths (10–15 m), little body movement, negative pitch in body orientation, and moderate body roll. Calling whales were also more likely to be traveling than milling, in groups rather than solitary, and without change in group size compared to non-calling whales. Conclusions: These are the first descriptions of body posture and depths at which fin whales are most likely to call, and some possible sound propagation and/or anatomical reasons for these results are considered. The call behavior characterizations presented here will help in predicting calling behavior from surface behavior, informing interpretation of passive acoustic data, and determining the effects of anthropogenic sound on whales in Southern California.","author":[{"family":"Stimpert","given":"Alison K."},{"family":"DeRuiter","given":"Stacy L."},{"family":"Falcone","given":"Erin A."},{"family":"Joseph","given":"John E."},{"family":"Douglas","given":"Annie B."},{"family":"Moretti","given":"David"},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari S."},{"literal":"John Calambokidis"},{"family":"Calambokidis","given":"John"},{"family":"Calambokidis","given":"John"},{"family":"Gailey","given":"Glenn"},{"literal":"Glenn Gailey"},{"family":"Gailey","given":"Glenn"},{"family":"Tyack","given":"Peter L."},{"family":"Goldbogen","given":"Jeremy A."}],"citation-key":"stimpert_etal15","container-title":"Animal Biotelemetry","DOI":"10.1186/s40317-015-0058-3","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,8,3]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2140955378","page":"23","title":"Sound production and associated behavior of tagged fin whales ( Balaenoptera physalus) in the Southern California Bight","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"stubbs_tolkamp06","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the control of energy balance in animals and man. We argue that patterns of mammalian feeding have evolved to control energy balance in uncertain environments. It is, therefore, expected that, under sedentary conditions in which the diet is rich in nutrients and abundantly available, animals and man will overeat. This suggests that no physiological defects are needed to induce overweight and ultimately obesity in man. Several considerations arise from these observations. The time period over which energy balance is controlled is far longer than allowed by most experiments. Physiological models of energy balance control often treat excess energy intake as a defect of regulation; ecological models view the same behaviour as part of normal energy balance control in environments where resources are uncertain. We apply these considerations to common patterns of human and animal feeding. We believe that the ecological perspective gives a more accurate explanation for the functionality of excess fat and the need to defend nutrient balance and avoid gross imbalances, as well as explaining hyperphagia in the face of plenty. By emphasising the common features of energy balance control in different mammalian species, the importance of changes in behaviour to accommodate changes in the environment becomes apparent. This also opens up possibilities for the control of body weight and the treatment of obesity in man.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Stubbs","given":"R.

  {"id":"sugasawa_etal17","abstract":"Hominins have been making tools for over three million years [1], yet the earliest known hooked tools appeared as recently as 90,000 years ago [2]. Hook innovation is likely to have boosted our ancestors’ hunting and fishing efficiency [3], marking a major transition in human technological evolution. The New Caledonian crow is the only non-human animal known to craft hooks in the wild [4, 5]. Crows manufacture hooked stick tools in a multi-stage process, involving the detachment of a branch from suitable vegetation; “sculpting” of a terminal hook from the nodal joint; and often additional adjustments, such as length trimming, shaft bending, and bark stripping [4, 6, 7]. Although tools made by a given population share key design features [4, 6, 8], they vary appreciably in overall shape and hook dimensions. Using wild-caught, temporarily captive crows, we experimentally investigated causes and consequences of variation in hook-tool morphology. We found that bird age, manufacture method, and raw-material properties influenced tool morphology, and that hook geometry in turn affected crows’ foraging efficiency. Specifically, hook depth varied with both detachment technique and plant rigidity, and deeper hooks enabled faster prey extraction in the provided tasks. Older crows manufactured tools of distinctive shape, with pronounced shaft curvature and hooks of intermediate depth. Future work should explore the interactive effects of extrinsic and intrinsic factors on tool production and deployment. Our study provides a quantitative assessment of the drivers and functional significance of tool shape variation in a non-human animal, affording valuable comparative insights into early hominin tool crafting [9].","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Sugasawa","given":"Shoko"},{"family":"Klump","given":"Barbara C."},{"family":"St Clair","given":"James J.

Muscle fat concentrations varied both within and between localities and lean eels with muscle fat concentrations <20% occurred at all study sites. Furthermore, no correlation could be found between muscle fat content and internal or external maturation indices, neither was the relative liver size related to the maturation process, as the correlation between the hepatosomatic and gonadosomatic indices was very weak. Consequently, it was concluded that silvering and the spawning migration may begin also at low muscle fat concentrations. However, most of the energy reserve is stored as muscle fat in eel, and it is highly unlikely that female silver eels with such low fat contents, as were observed occasionally in this study, will ever recruit to the next generation. Therefore, it is suggested that the maturation process in eel is more flexible than previously recognized, and that this process might be temporarily arrested and feeding resumed during the first part of the migratory phase.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Svedäng","given":"H."},{"family":"Wickström","given":"H."}],"citation-key":"svedang_wickstrom97","container-title":"Journal of Fish Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1095-8649.1997.tb01943.x","ISSN":"1095-8649","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1997]]},"language":"en","page":"475-486","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Low fat contents in female silver eels: indications of insufficient energetic stores for migration and gonadal development","title-short":"Low fat contents in female silver eels","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1997.tb01943.x","volume":"50"},

Results from net tows conducted between late May and September 2008 and a single, opportunistic dip-net sample on 21 April indicate that Thysanoessa raschii and T. longipes spawned in association with the spring phytoplankton bloom in April and continued spawning until June, with juveniles first appearing in mid- to late June. Presence of female T. spinifera carrying spermatophores in mid-April indicates that T. spinifera spawns in association with the spring bloom as well; however, absence of larval T. spinifera suggest that spawning in the inshore waters is comparatively rare. In contrast, observations of female Euphausia pacifica carrying spermatophores from late May to August and the first appearance of early furcilia in August indicate that spawning occurs, at least to some extent, after the primary bloom. However, the appearance of juvenile E. pacifica in late June suggests that spawning occurred earlier as well and in discrete bouts. We argue that the absence of E. pacifica furcilia that were likely to have originated from an early spawning event may indicate that E. pacifica juveniles observed in late June were advected into the study region from the Gulf of Alaska.

  {"id":"szabo15","abstract":"Humpbacks whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) have shown a remarkable recovery in the North Pacific, raising concerns regarding their impact on marine communities. In Southeast Alaska, humpbacks feed heavily on euphausiids; however, it remains unclear whether they target immature individuals despite evidence that they do so elsewhere. I evaluate the hypothesis that humpbacks target immature euphausiids in late spring-summer in Southeast Alaska. Plankton samples were collected at random sites (n = 44) and near whales (n = 53) between 8 June and 9 September 2008 in Frederick Sound and Stephens Passage. The proportion of samples containing immature euphausiids, and immature euphausiid abundance within those samples, were compared between the two sample types. Similar analyses were conducted for adult euphausiids (prey) and calanoid copepods (nonprey) for comparison. I found no statistical difference between the whale and random samples with respect to the occurrence or numerical density of immature euphausiids, which is consistent with the hypothesis that whales did not target them in 2008. Smaller size, insufficient numerical densities and lower energy density of immature euphausiids are suggested as possible reasons. These findings can assist in resolving regional humpback abundance and distribution patterns, and can contribute to an understanding of the trophic interactions characterizing the local ecosystem.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Szabo","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"szabo15","container-title":"Marine Mammal Science","DOI":"10.1111/mms.12183","ISSN":"1748-7692","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","page":"677-687","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Immature euphausiids do not appear to be prey for humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) during spring and summer in Southeast Alaska","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mms.12183","volume":"31"},
  {"id":"szesciorka_etal19","abstract":"Despite efforts to aid recovery, Eastern North Pacific blue whales faces numerous anthropogenic threats. These include behavioral disturbances and noise interference with communication, but also direct physical harm—notably injury and mortality from ship strikes. Factors leading to ship strikes are poorly understood, with virtually nothing known about the cues available to blue whales from nearby vessels, behavioral responses during close encounters, or how these events may contribute to subsequent responses. At what distance and received levels (RLs) of noise whales respond to potential collisions is difficult to observe. A unique case study of a close passage between a commercial vessel and a blue whale off Southern California is presented here. This whale was being closely monitored as part of another experiment after two suction-cup archival tags providing acoustic, depth, kinematic, and location data were attached to the whale. The calibrated, high-resolution data provided an opportunity to examine the sensory information available to the whale and its response during the close encounter. Complementary data streams from the whale and ship enabled a precise calculation of the distance and acoustic cues recorded on the tag when the whale initiated a behavioral response and shortly after at the closest point of approach (CPA). Immediately before the CPA, the whale aborted its ascent and remained at a depth sufficient to avoid being struck for ~3 min until the ship passed. In this encounter, the whale may have responded to a combination of cues associated with the close proximity of the vessel to avoid a collision. Long-term photo-identification records indicate that this whale has a long sighting history in the region, with evidence of previous ship encounters. Therefore, experiential factors may have facilitated the avoidance of a collision. In some instances these factors may not be available, which may make some blue whales particularly susceptible to deadly collisions, rendering efforts for ship-strike reduction even more challenging. The fine-scale information made available by the integration of these methods and technologies demonstrates the capacity for detailed behavioral studies of blue whales and other highly mobile marine megafauna, which will contribute to more informed evaluation and mitigation strategies.","author":[{"family":"Szesciorka","given":"Angela R."},{"family":"Allen","given":"Ann N."},{"family":"Calambokidis","given":"John"},{"family":"Calambokidis","given":"John"},{"family":"Fahlbusch","given":"James A."},{"family":"McKenna","given":"Megan F."},{"family":"Southall","given":"Brandon L."}],"citation-key":"szesciorka_etal19","container-title":"Frontiers in Marine Science","DOI":"10.3389/fmars.2019.00761","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,10]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2994789905","title":"A Case Study of a Near Vessel Strike of a Blue Whale: Perceptual Cues and Fine-Scale Aspects of Behavioral Avoidance","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"tackaberry_etal20","abstract":"Nursing influences growth rate and overall health of mammals; however, the behavior is difficult to study in wild cetaceans because it occurs below the surface and can thus be misidentified from surface observations. Nursing has been observed in humpback whales on the breeding and calving grounds, but the behavior remains unstudied on the feeding grounds. We instrumented three dependent calves (four total deployments) with combined video and 3D-accelerometer data loggers (CATS) on two United States feeding grounds to document nursing events. Two associated mothers were also tagged to determine if behavior diagnostic of nursing was evident in the mother’s movement. Animal-borne video was manually analyzed and the average duration of successful nursing events was 23 s (±7 sd, n = 11). Nursing occurred at depths between 4.1–64.4 m (along the seafloor) and in close temporal proximity to foraging events by the mothers, but could not be predicted solely by relative positions of mother and calf. When combining all calf deployments, successful nursing was documented eleven times; totaling only 0.3% of 21.0 hours of video. During nursing events, calves had higher overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) and increased fluke-stroke rate (FSR) compared to non-nursing segments (Mixed effect models, ODBA: F1,107 = 13.57756, p = 0.0004, FSR: F1,107 = 32.31018, p < 0.0001).

  {"id":"tamura_konishi09","abstract":"The Antarctic minke whale (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) is the most abundant baleen whale species in the Southern Ocean. Quantitative information on prey consumption of whales is useful to understand their feeding ecology and role in the ecosystem. The purposes of this study are 1) to investigate the feeding habit of Antarctic minke whales based on information on prey species, freshness and diurnal change in stomach contents, and 2) to estimate the amount of prey consumed by whales. Estimates are made for whales of different sexual maturity classes as it is expected that the energy requirements vary among them. The analysis is based on the data from whales taken by JARPA (Japanese Whale Research Program under Special Permit in the Antarctic) in a longitudinal sector between 35º E and 145º W, and south of 60º S. Sampling was conducted in the austral summer seasons from 1987/1988 to 2004/2005, mainly in the months from December to March. Daily prey consumption by the whales in each sexual maturity class was estimated using energy-requirement and energy deposition. The whales feed mainly before 05:00 h, which suggest that they cease to feed early in the day. Daily prey consumptions were estimated to be 83.7–325.5 kg, equivalent to 2.7–4.0% of body weight. The mean prey consumptions per capita during feeding season were 7.5 and 16.4 t for immature and mature male, 12.5 and 39.1 t for immature and mature female, respectively. In Area IV (70°–130°E), total prey consumptions of krill by Antarctic minke whales in 1999/2000 and 2001/2002 seasons were estimated to be 0.9 and 1.1 million t, respectively. In Area V (130° E–170° W including the Ross Sea), these estimates in 2000/2001 and 2002/2003 seasons were 3.9 and 4.1 million t, respectively. The estimations of feeding impact on krill resources by Antarctic minke whales in Areas IV and V were from 2.7 to 3.2%, and from 18.2 to 18.9% of krill biomasses, respectively. These results on prey consumption are important input data for the development of ecosystem modeling in the Southern Ocean.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Tamura","given":"T"},{"family":"Konishi","given":"K"}],"citation-key":"tamura_konishi09","container-title":"Journal of Northwest Atlantic Fishery Science","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"taylor_etal11","abstract":"Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) is considered to be overfished, but the status of its populations has been debated, partly because of uncertainties regarding the effects of mixing on fishing grounds. A better understanding of spatial structure and mixing may help fisheries managers to successfully rebuild populations to sustainable levels while maximizing catches. We formulate a new seasonally and spatially explicit fisheries model that is fitted to conventional and electronic tag data, historic catch-at-age reconstructions, and otolith microchemistry stock-composition data to improve the capacity to assess past, current, and future population sizes of Atlantic bluefin tuna. We apply the model to estimate spatial and temporal mixing of the eastern (Mediterranean) and western (Gulf of Mexico) populations, and to reconstruct abundances from 1950 to 2008. We show that western and eastern populations have been reduced to 17% and 33%, respectively, of 1950 spawning stock biomass levels. Overfishing to below the biomass that produces maximum sustainable yield occurred in the 1960s and the late 1990s for western and eastern populations, respectively. The model predicts that mixing depends on season, ontogeny, and location, and is highest in the western Atlantic. Assuming that future catches are zero, western and eastern populations are predicted to recover to levels at maximum sustainable yield by 2025 and 2015, respectively. However, the western population will not recover with catches of 1750 and 12,900 tonnes (the “rebuilding quotas”) in the western and eastern Atlantic, respectively, with or without closures in the Gulf of Mexico. If future catches are double the rebuilding quotas, then rebuilding of both populations will be compromised. If fishing were to continue in the eastern Atlantic at the unregulated levels of 2007, both stocks would continue to decline. Since populations mix on North Atlantic foraging grounds, successful rebuilding policies will benefit from trans-Atlantic cooperation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Taylor","given":"Nathan G."},{"family":"McAllister","given":"Murdoch K."},{"family":"Lawson","given":"Gareth L."},{"family":"Carruthers","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Block","given":"Barbara A."}],"citation-key":"taylor_etal11","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0027693","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"language":"en","page":"e27693","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Atlantic Bluefin Tuna: A Novel Multistock Spatial Model for Assessing Population Biomass","title-short":"Atlantic Bluefin Tuna","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0027693","volume":"6"},

Constraining when migration became established and assessing how it has changed through time may yield valuable insight into the evolution of mysticete whales and the oceans in which they lived. However, there are currently few data which directly assess prehistoric mysticete migrations. Here we show that calcite δ18O profiles of two species of modern whale barnacles (coronulids) accurately reflect the known migration routes of their host whales. We then analyze well-preserved fossil coronulids from three different locations along the eastern Pacific coast, finding that δ18O profiles from these fossils exhibit trends and ranges similar to modern specimens. Our results demonstrate that migration is an ancient behavior within the humpback and gray whale lineages and that multiple Pleistocene populations were undertaking migrations of an extent similar to those of the present day.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Taylor","given":"Larry D."},{"family":"O’Dea","given":"Aaron"},{"family":"Bralower","given":"Timothy J."},{"family":"Finnegan","given":"Seth"}],"citation-key":"taylor_etal19a","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1808759116","issue":"15","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,9]]},"page":"7377-7381","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"pnas.org (Atypon)","title":"Isotopes from fossil coronulid barnacle shells record evidence of migration in multiple Pleistocene whale populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1808759116","volume":"116"},
  {"id":"taylor_etal82","abstract":"This series of four papers investigates the link between the energetics and the mechanics of terrestrial locomotion. Two experimental variables are used throughout the study: speed and body size. Mass-specific metabolic rates of running animals can be varied by about tenfold using either variable. This first paper considers metabolic energy consumed during terrestrial locomotion. New data relating rate of oxygen consumption and speed are reported for: eight species of wild and domestic artiodactyls; seven species of carnivores; four species of primates; and one species of rodent. These are combined with previously published data to formulate a new allometric equation relating mass-specific rates of oxygen consumed (VO2/Mb) during locomotion at a constant speed to speed and body  mass (based on data from 62 avian and mammalian species): VO2/Mb = 0.533 Mb-0.316.vg + 0.300 Mb-0.303 where VO2/Mb has the units ml O2 s-1 kg-1; Mb is in kg; and vg is in m s-1. This equation can be expressed in terms of mass-specific rates of energy consumption (Emetab/Mb) using the energetic equivalent of 1 ml O2 = 20.1 J because the contribution of anaerobic glycolysis was negligible: Emetab/Mb = 10.7 Mb-0.316.vg + 6.03 Mb-0.303 where Emetab/Mb has the units watts/kg. This new relationship applies equally well to bipeds and quadrupeds and differs little from the allometric equation reported 12 years ago by Taylor, Schmid-Nielsen & Raab (1970). Ninety per cent of the values calculated from this genera equation for the diverse assortment of avian and mammalian species included in this regression fall within 25% of the observed values at the middle of the speed range where measurements were made. This agreement is impressive when one considers that mass-specific rates of oxygen consumption differed by more than 1400% over this size range of animals.","author":[{"family":"Taylor","given":"C.

The proportion of time spent at sea, mean trip duration, and mean foraging range were all positively related to body size.

  {"id":"torres_bierlich20","abstract":"Body size is recognized as one of the most important factors that determine animal function and performance in its environment (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1984) and well-sampled and accurate size measurements of wild animals can indicate population health (Altmann, Schoeller, Altmann, Muruthi, & Sapolsky, 1993; French, González-Suárez, Young, Durham, & [Gerber], 2011; Hilderbrand et al., 1999). However, estimating the body size of large wild vertebrates, like many cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) is particularly challenging, as their mobility and large size impedes in situ measurements or live capture (Goldbogen et al., 2015; Huang, Chou, & Ni, 2009). Historically, lethal sampling, either scientifically or opportunistically from commercial whaling, has provided measurements of large whales in the past (Christiansen, Vı́kingsson, Rasmussen, & Lusseau, 2014; Ichii & Kato, 1991; Lockyer, McConnell, & Waters, 1985; Mackintosh & Wheeler, 1929), but these methods are often not permissible today, expensive, and/or are considered unethical and biased (Baker, Lento, Cipriano, Dalebout, & Palumbi, 2000; Clapham et al., 2003; Clapham & Ivashchenko, 2018). Alternatively, aerial photogrammetry has proven to be a reliable non-invasive method for obtaining measurements of many megavertebrates, such as cetaceans (Miller, Best, Perryman, Baumgartner, & Moore, 2012; Perryman & Lynn, 2002), and the recent advancement of unoccupied aircraft systems (UAS, or drones) has enabled a more affordable, efficient, and accessible means of acquiring high-resolution aerial imagery for morphometric analysis (Christiansen et al., 2018; Durban, Fearnbach, Barrett-Lennard, Perryman, & Leroi, 2015; Johnston, 2019).

  {"id":"trondrud_etal21","abstract":"The fasting endurance hypothesis (FEH) predicts strong selection for large body size in mammals living in environments where food supply is interrupted over prolonged periods of time. The Arctic is a highly seasonal and food-restricted environment, but contrary to predictions from the FEH, empirical evidence shows that Arctic mammals are often smaller than their temperate conspecifics. Intraspecific studies integrating physiology and behaviour of different-sized individuals may shed light on this paradox. We tested the FEH in free-living Svalbard reindeer Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus. We measured daily energy expenditure (DEE), subcutaneous body temperature (Tsc) and activity levels during the late winter in 14 adult females with body masses ranging from 46.3 to 57.8 kg. Winter energy expenditure (WEE) and fasting endurance (FE) were modelled dynamically by combining these data with body composition measurements of culled individuals at the onset of winter (14 years, n = 140) and variation in activity level throughout winter (10 years, n = 70). Mean DEE was 6.3 ± 0.7 MJ/day. Lean mass, Tsc and activity had significantly positive effects on DEE. Across all 140 individuals, mean FE was 85 ± 17 days (range 48–137 days). In contrast to the predictions of the FEH, the dominant factor affecting FE was initial fat mass, while body mass and FE were not correlated. Furthermore, lean mass and fat mass were not correlated. FE was on average 80% (45 days) longer in fat than lean individuals of the same size. Reducing activity levels by 16% or Tsc by 5% increased FE by 7% and 4% respectively. Our results fail to support the FEH. Rather, we demonstrate that (a) the size of fat reserves can be independent of lean mass and body size within a species, (b) ecological and environmental variation influence FE via their effects on body composition and (c) physiological and behavioural adjustments can improve FE within individuals. Altogether, our results suggest that there is a selection in Svalbard reindeer to accumulate body fat, rather than to grow structurally large.

  {"id":"tyack_etal11","abstract":"Beaked whales have mass stranded during some naval sonar exercises, but the cause is unknown. They are difficult to sight but can reliably be detected by listening for echolocation clicks produced during deep foraging dives. Listening for these clicks, we documented Blainville's beaked whales, Mesoplodon densirostris, in a naval underwater range where sonars are in regular use near Andros Island, Bahamas. An array of bottom-mounted hydrophones can detect beaked whales when they click anywhere within the range. We used two complementary methods to investigate behavioral responses of beaked whales to sonar: an opportunistic approach that monitored whale responses to multi-day naval exercises involving tactical mid-frequency sonars, and an experimental approach using playbacks of simulated sonar and control sounds to whales tagged with a device that records sound, movement, and orientation. Here we show that in both exposure conditions beaked whales stopped echolocating during deep foraging dives and moved away. During actual sonar exercises, beaked whales were primarily detected near the periphery of the range, on average 16 km away from the sonar transmissions. Once the exercise stopped, beaked whales gradually filled in the center of the range over 2–3 days. A satellite tagged whale moved outside the range during an exercise, returning over 2–3 days post-exercise. The experimental approach used tags to measure acoustic exposure and behavioral reactions of beaked whales to one controlled exposure each of simulated military sonar, killer whale calls, and band-limited noise. The beaked whales reacted to these three sound playbacks at sound pressure levels below 142 dB re 1 µPa by stopping echolocation followed by unusually long and slow ascents from their foraging dives. The combined results indicate similar disruption of foraging behavior and avoidance by beaked whales in the two different contexts, at exposures well below those used by regulators to define disturbance.","author":[{"family":"Tyack","given":"Peter L."},{"family":"Zimmer","given":"Walter M.

  {"id":"tyson_etal12","abstract":"Previously, all inferences regarding fine-scale baleen whale mothercalf relation- ships have come from surface observations, aerial surveys, or underwater video recordings. On May 19, 2010, we attached high-resolution digital acoustic recording tags (Dtags) to an adult female humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae and her calf in Wilhelmina Bay (Western Antarctic Peninsula) to examine their concurrent diving and foraging behaviour. The Dtags logged ~20 h of concurrent recordings. We used cross-correlation analyses to quantify synchrony between the pair. Dive depth was positively correlated for the duration of the concurrent record and was highest when the calf's track lagged behind the mother's by 4.5 s, suggesting that the calf was 'following' its mother. Pitch and heading were positively correlated but to a lesser degree. Both animals executed feeding lunges; however, the mother foraged more intensively than the calf (792 and 118 lunges over 246 and 30 feeding dives, respectively). Also, the mother fed consis- tently once she initiated feeding at 16:22:00 h until the tag came off, whereas the calf executed 95.76% of its lunges between 17:00:08 and 19:28:21 h, local time. Correlation coefficients calcu- lated per dive were highest when both animals were feeding and lowest when only the mother was feeding. In addition, 84.26 and 79.63% of the calf's lunges were performed within ±20 s and ±20 m of its mother's lunges, respectively. Our work describes the first record of a long-term con- tinuous underwater relationship and foraging behaviour of a humpback mothercalf pair.","author":[{"family":"Tyson","given":"Reny B."},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari S."},{"family":"Ware","given":"Colin"},{"family":"Stimpert","given":"Alison K."},{"family":"Nowacek","given":"Douglas P."}],"citation-key":"tyson_etal12","container-title":"Marine Ecology Progress Series","DOI":"10.3354/meps09708","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,6,21]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2034837009","page":"209-220","title":"Synchronous mother and calf foraging behaviour in humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae: insights from multi-sensor suction cup tags","type":"article-journal","volume":"457"},

Here, we describe the scaling of mechanical work demand each stride, and the mechanical power demand each stance. Unlike muscle stress, strain and strain rate, these mechanical demands cannot be circumvented by changing the muscle gearing with minor adaptations in bone geometry or trivial adjustments to limb posture. Constraints to the capacity of muscle to supply work and power impose fundamental limitations to maximum speed. Given an upper limit to muscle work capacity each contraction, maximum speeds in big animals are constrained by the mechanical work demand each step. With an upper limit to instantaneous muscle power production, maximal speeds in small animals are limited by the high power demands during brief stance periods. The high maximum speed of the cheetah may therefore be attributed as much to its size as to its other anatomical and physiological adaptations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Usherwood","given":"J.

We used multi-model inference and model averaging to evaluate the relative importance of various static and dynamic environmental conditions on the movement characteristics: speed, turning angle, dive duration, dive depth, dive wiggliness (a proxy for prey chasing behaviour), and post-dive duration. Despite substantial individual differences in horizontal and vertical movement patterns, we found that all the tracked porpoises responded similar to variation in environmental conditions and displayed movements that indicate a higher likelihood of foraging behaviour in shallower and more saline waters.

These costs have never been measured in free-swimming cetaceans. To examine the effect of drag from a tag on metabolic rate, cost of transport and swimming behavior, four captive male dolphins ( Tursiops truncatus ) were trained to swim a set course, either non-tagged ( n =7) or fitted with a tag (DTAG2;  n =12), and surface exclusively in a flow-through respirometer in which oxygen consumption () and carbon dioxide production (; ml kg −1  min −1 ) rates were measured and respiratory exchange ratio (/) was calculated. Tags did not significantly affect individual mass-specific oxygen consumption, physical activity ratios (exercise /resting ), total or net cost of transport (COT; J m −1  kg −1 ) or locomotor costs during swimming or two-minute recovery phases. However, individuals swam significantly slower when tagged (by ~11%; mean ± s.d., 3.31±0.35 m s −1 ) than when non-tagged (3.73±0.41 m s −1 ). A combined theoretical and computational fluid dynamics model estimating drag forces and power exertion during swimming suggests that drag loading and energy consumption are reduced at lower swimming speeds. Bottlenose dolphins in the specific swimming task in this experiment slowed to the point where the tag yielded no increases in drag or power, while showing no difference in metabolic parameters when instrumented with a DTAG2. These results, and our observations, suggest that animals modify their behavior to maintain metabolic output and energy expenditure when faced with tag-induced drag.","author":[{"family":"Hoop","given":"Julie M.","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Fahlman","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Hurst","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Rocho-Levine","given":"Julie"},{"family":"Shorter","given":"K.

Entanglement in fishing gear adds significant drag and buoyant forces that can impact swimming behaviors across a range of timescales. We deployed biologging tags during the disentanglement of 2 North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis to (1) examine how their kinematics changed in response to drag and buoyancy from entanglement in fishing gear, and (2) calculate resultant changes in swimming efficiency for one individual. We observed variable responses in dive behavior, but neither whale appeared to exploit added buoyancy to reduce energy expenditure. While some of the observed changes in behavior were individually specific, some swimming kinematics were consistently modulated in response to high drag and buoyancy associated with entangling gear, affecting thrust production. In high drag and buoyancy conditions, fluke strokes were significantly shorter and more variable in shape, and gliding was less frequent. Thrust and efficiency significantly differed among dive phases. Disentanglement reduced thrust coefficients ~4-fold, leading to 1.2 to 1.8-fold lower power (W). Ideal propulsive efficiency was significantly lower when entangled, though we detected no difference in observed propulsive efficiency between the conditions. Similar to carrying heavy objects or changing shoes, we present another condition where animals perceive unique movement constraints over seconds to minutes and develop compensatory strategies, altering their movement accordingly.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoop","given":"Jm","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Nowacek","given":"Dp"},{"family":"Moore","given":"Mj"},{"family":"Triantafyllou","given":"Ms"}],"citation-key":"vanderhoop_etal17","container-title":"Endangered Species Research","DOI":"10.3354/esr00781","ISSN":"1863-5407, 1613-4796","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","page":"1-17","source":"Crossref","title":"Swimming kinematics and efficiency of entangled North Atlantic right whales","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/esr/v32/p1-17/","volume":"32"},
  {"id":"vanderhoop_etal19","abstract":"North Atlantic right whales spend their summer months foraging primarily in American and Canadian Atlantic waters on high-energy-density prey. Here, they rapidly accumulate and store energy obtained within a few months to support future migrations and reproduction while fasting. High drag from their ram-filter foraging strategy places a limit on what prey densities will be energetically efficient to target. Our understanding of the volume of prey-laden water filtered by right whales during a dive or foraging bout, and what information they use to decide to forage or not, has been limited by the difficulties of measuring when they feed at depth, how fast they swim during continuous ram filtration and how often they might swallow accumulated prey. We used 10 DTAG deployments from right whales in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, to quantify swimming speeds and estimate the volume of prey-laden water filtered per dive. We used the tag's inertial sensors to evaluate the timing of frequent biomechanical changes that likely indicate the truncation of continuous filtration, and whether the number or timing of these fluking bouts relates to longer feeding dives or other foraging decisions. During foraging dives, right whales descended at 1.4 (±0.2 SD) m/s and slowed to swim at 1.1 (±0.3) m/s while filtering. We found consistent pauses in the fluking behaviour of foraging right whales, every 56 (±22) s. Whales filtered on average 78 (±30) m3 of water per fluking bout and on average 673 (±201) m3 per dive. Right whales filter large volumes of water at low speeds with a high duty cycle, but require sufficiently high prey energy densities to compensate for a high-drag foraging strategy. Closely related bowhead whales have a larger gape but swim more slowly, filtering greater volumes with lower drag. Our findings highlight that right whales acquire their energy in a relatively short period of intense foraging; even moderate changes in their feeding behaviour or their prey energy density are likely to negatively impact their yearly energy budgets and therefore reduce fitness substantially.

  {"id":"vanmilgen_noblet03","abstract":"ABSTRACT: Modeling aspects of energy metabolism in growing pigs involves establishing “rules” on the partitioning of dietary energy between protein deposition (PD), lipid deposition (LD), and heat production (HP) at a given point in time, as well as the changes that occur during growth. Growing pigs rarely retain more than 50% of their ME intake; the remainder is lost as heat. Part of the heat loss is due to the heat increment, which includes the transformation of dietary nutrients to PD and LD, and to the associated energy (ATP) cost. Consequently, different nutrients are used with different efﬁciencies and, due to the ATP cost associated with protein synthesis and turnover, PD is energetically less efﬁcient than LD. Different modeling approaches have been adopted to represent partitioning of energy between PD and LD (e.g., by assuming minimal ratios of LD:PD, marginal LD:PD, and lipid:protein mass or the existence of an upper limit to PD). Most of the HP is associated with biophysical processes (e.g., “maintenance,” physical activity) requiring ATP, which are not directly related to PD and LD. Since it is virtually impossible to obtain direct estimates of these ATP requirements, indirect methods must be used. For example, the cost of maintenance may be estimated by measuring the fasting HP. Estimates of the fasting HP typically range from 700 to 800 kJ/(kg of BW0.60ؒd), which corresponds to 50 to 60% of the total HP. Also, HP associated with physical activity is an important component of HP (15%), but can be variable between individual animals. Feed intake in nonproducing, mature mammals theoretically equals maintenance energy requirements. This implies that, while maturing, maintenance will become an increasingly important component of energy intake. In addition, while maturing, a decreasing fraction of the energy intake above maintenance is used for PD. The result is that PD typically reaches a maximum at 60 to 80 kg in growing pigs and decreases thereafter. In contrast, with aging, an increasing fraction of the available energy is used for LD, and maximal LD may not be reached before slaughter (110 to 130 kg). In modeling, this has been represented by assuming that the aforementioned energy partitioning rules (e.g., minimal LD:PD ratio, upper limit to PD) change with BW and/or age.","author":[{"family":"Milgen","given":"J","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Noblet","given":"J"}],"citation-key":"vanmilgen_noblet03","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"language":"en","page":"10","source":"Zotero","title":"Partitioning of energy intake to heat, protein, and fat in growing pigs","type":"article-journal"},

Median received spectrum levels of noise from 2,809 isolated transits are elevated relative to median background levels not only at low frequencies (20–30 dB re 1 µPa2/Hz from 100 to 1,000 Hz), but also at high frequencies (5–13 dB from 10,000 to 96,000 Hz). Thus, noise received from ships at ranges less than 3 km extends to frequencies used by odontocetes. Broadband received levels (11.5–40,000 Hz) near the shoreline in Haro Strait (WA, USA) for the entire ship population were 110 ± 7 dB re 1 µPa on average. Assuming near-spherical spreading based on a transmission loss experiment we compute mean broadband source levels for the ship population of 173 ± 7 dB re 1 µPa 1 m without accounting for frequency-dependent absorption. Mean ship speed was 7.3 ± 2.0 m/s (14.1 ± 3.9 knots). Most ship classes show a linear relationship between source level and speed with a slope near +2 dB per m/s (+1 dB/knot). Spectrum, 1/12-octave, and 1/3-octave source levels for the whole population have median values that are comparable to previous measurements and models at most frequencies, but for select studies may be relatively low below 200 Hz and high above 20,000 Hz. Median source spectrum levels peak near 50 Hz for all 12 ship classes, have a maximum of 159 dB re 1 µPa2/Hz @ 1 m for container ships, and vary between classes. Below 200 Hz, the class-specific median spectrum levels bifurcate with large commercial ships grouping as higher power noise sources. Within all ship classes spectrum levels vary more at low frequencies than at high frequencies, and the degree of variability is almost halved for classes that have smaller speed standard deviations. This is the first study to present source spectra for populations of different ship classes operating in coastal habitats, including at higher frequencies used by killer whales for both communication and echolocation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Veirs","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Veirs","given":"Val"},{"family":"Wood","given":"Jason D."}],"citation-key":"veirs_etal16","container-title":"PeerJ","container-title-short":"PeerJ","DOI":"10.7717/peerj.1657","ISSN":"2167-8359","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"e1657","publisher":"PeerJ Inc.","source":"peerj.com","title":"Ship noise extends to frequencies used for echolocation by endangered killer whales","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://peerj.com/articles/1657","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"videsen_etal17","abstract":"The migration of humpback whales to and from their breeding grounds results in a short, critical time period during which neonatal calves must acquire sufficient energy via suckling from their fasting mothers to survive the long return journey. Understanding neonate suckling behaviour is critical for understanding the energetics and evolution of humpback whale migratory behaviour and for informing conservation efforts, but despite its importance, very little is known about the details, rate and behavioural context of this critical energy transfer. To address this pertinent data gap on calf suckling behaviour, we deployed multi-sensor Dtags on eight humpback whale calves and two mothers allowing us to analyse detailed suckling and acoustic behaviour for a total of 68·8 h. Suckling dives were performed 20·7 ± 7% of the total tagging time with the mothers either resting at the surface or at depth with the calves hanging motionless with roll and pitch angles close to zero. Vocalisations between mother and calf, which included very weak tonal and grunting sounds, were produced more frequently during active dives than suckling dives, suggesting that mechanical stimuli rather than acoustic cues are used to initiate nursing. Use of mechanical cues for initiating suckling and low level vocalisations with an active space of <100 m indicate a strong selection pressure for acoustic crypsis. Such inconspicuous behaviour likely reduces the risk of exposure to eavesdropping predators and male humpback whale escorts that may disrupt the high proportion of time spent nursing and resting, and hence ultimately compromise calf fitness. The small active space of the weak calls between mother and calf is very sensitive to increases in ambient noise from human encroachment thereby increasing the risk of mother–calf separation.

  {"id":"villegas-amtmann_etal15","abstract":"While sophisticated tools are used to monitor behavioral changes of large marine vertebrates, determining whether these changes are meaningful for management and conservation is challenging. The Population Consequences of Disturbance model proposed a bioenergetics model to detect biologically meaningful population responses, where disturbance costs are linked to lost energy. The model assumes that changes in behavior, caused by disturbance, compromise maternal condition, reducing energy delivery to offspring, leading to reduced reproduction, increased offspring mortality, and eventually increased adult mortality. Given its coastal habits and past whaling history, gray whales' (Eschrichtius robustus) life history and ecology are better known than for many other baleen whales. However, their preference for coastal habitat increases their exposure to human disturbance. We created a female gray whale bioenergetics model to determine energy requirements for a two-year reproductive cycle and determined the consequences of lost energy under three possible disturbance scenarios. An annual energetic loss of 4% during the year in which she is pregnant, would prevent a female from successfully producing/weaning a calf. For this reason, gray whale reproduction is particularly sensitive to disturbance during pregnancy. During the year in which she is lactating, she would wean her calf at a lower mass with a 37% energetic loss. A female would lack the energy to become pregnant during a year with a 30–35% energetic loss, and female mortality would likely occur at 40–42% annual energetic loss. Our model can be used for assessing disturbance costs or other effects associated with climate change and/or anthropogenic activities and can be applied to other species with similar life histories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Villegas-Amtmann","given":"S."},{"family":"Schwarz","given":"L.

  {"id":"villegas-amtmann_etal17","abstract":"Western gray whales (WGW) Eschrichtius robustus are considered one of the world’s most endangered baleen whale populations. Development of oil and gas fields in northeastern Sakhalin, Russia, is a concern, because they overlap with WGW feeding grounds. Some WGW migrate ~10 000 km from feeding grounds around Sakhalin Island (Russia), to breeding grounds in Baja California (BajaC; Mexico) and possibly ~6000 km to the South China Sea (China). We developed a WGW female bioenergetics model to examine potential consequences of energy lost from foraging cessation caused by anthropogenic disturbance, and compared it to eastern gray whales (EGW). Energy loss was then linked to potential reductions in reproduction and survival. Mean total energy requirements were 11 and 15% greater for WGW breeding in BajaC and China, respectively, compared to EGW, due to longer migration distance (25%) to BajaC and higher metabolic rates at foraging grounds. However, this difference is minimal for EGW that use the northern extent of their foraging range. On average, WGW breeding in BajaC and China need 9 and 17% more energy for survival than EGW. Our model predicts that WGW mortality would likely occur at 38 to 40% annual energetic loss. Long-term yearly energy loss of < 30% would reduce population growth due to lower reproductive rates. Ongoing yearly energy losses of > 30% would result in adult female mortality the first year, followed by lower reproductive rates of survivors. Our model suggests that energy losses of > 30% caused by disturbance should be considered a threshold for concern for this Critically Endangered population.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Villegas-Amtmann","given":"S"},{"family":"Schwarz","given":"Lk"},{"family":"Gailey","given":"G"},{"family":"Sychenko","given":"O"},{"family":"Costa","given":"Dp"}],"citation-key":"villegas-amtmann_etal17","container-title":"Endangered Species Research","container-title-short":"Endang.

This will affect many marine organisms, particularly those with high site fidelity and habitat temperature preferences, such as humpback whales on their breeding grounds. To study the impacts of a warming ocean on marine organisms, large-scale projections of climatic variables are crucial. Global models are of 0.25 - 1° (~25-100 km) resolution, and not ideal to predict localized changes. Here, we provide 0.05° resolution (~5 km) sea surface temperature (SST) projections, statistically downscaled using the delta method. We illustrate the shifting isotherms of the critical 21 and 28°C boundaries, which border the climatic envelope that humpback whales prefer for their breeding grounds, over the course of the 21st century on a decadal temporal resolution. Results show by the end of the 21st century, 35% of humpback whale breeding areas will experience SSTs above or within 1°C of current thresholds if present-day social, economic, and technological trends continue (‘middle of the road’ CMIP6 greenhouse gas trajectory SSP2-RCP4.5). This number rises to 67% under the scenario describing rapid economic growth in carbon-intensive industries (‘fossil-fueled development’ CMIP6 greenhouse gas trajectory SSP5-RCP8.5). These projections highlight the importance of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions and minimizing further SST increases to preserve ecological integrity of humpback whale breeding areas. In this context, our results emphasize the need to focus on protection of critical ocean habitat and to provide high-resolution climate data for this purpose.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hammerstein","given":"Hannah","non-dropping-particle":"von"},{"family":"Setter","given":"Renee O."},{"family":"Aswegen","given":"Martin","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Currie","given":"Jens J."},{"family":"Stack","given":"Stephanie H."}],"citation-key":"vonhammerstein_etal22","container-title":"Frontiers in Marine Science","ISSN":"2296-7745","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"High-Resolution Projections of Global Sea Surface Temperatures Reveal Critical Warming in Humpback Whale Breeding Grounds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmars.2022.837772","volume":"9"},

To understand the kinematics of humpback lunge feeding, we attached high-resolution digital recording tags incorporating accelerometers, magnetometers, pressure and sound recording to whales feeding on euphausiids in fjords of the West Antarctic Peninsula. Instances of near vertical lunges gave us the unique opportunity to use the signal from the accelerometer to obtain a fine scale record of the body accelerations involved in lunging. We found that lunges contain extreme accelerations reaching 2.5 m/s2 in certain instances, which are then followed by decelerations. When animals are intensively feeding the inter-lunge interval is similar for both deep and shallow lunges suggesting a biomechanical constraint on lunges. However, the number of lunges per dive varies from one for shallow feeding (<25 m) to a median of six for deeper dives. Different feeding patterns were evident in the kinematic record, for deep and shallow feeding bouts with the much greater mean turn rates occurring in shallow feeding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Ware","given":"Colin"},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari S."},{"family":"Nowacek","given":"Douglas P."}],"citation-key":"ware_etal11","container-title":"Marine Mammal Science","DOI":"10.1111/j.1748-7692.2010.00427.x","ISSN":"1748-7692","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"language":"en","page":"587-605","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Shallow and deep lunge feeding of humpback whales in fjords of the West Antarctic Peninsula","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1748-7692.2010.00427.x","volume":"27"},

Here we report on the use of synchronous motion and acoustic recording tags (DTAGs) to provide the first detailed kinematic descriptions of humpback whales using bottom side-rolls (BSRs) to feed along the seafloor. We recorded 3,505 events from 19 animals (individual range 8–722). By animal, mean BSR duration ranged from 14.1 s to 36.2 s.; mean body roll angle from 80º to 121º, and mean pitch from 7º to 38º. The median interval between sequential BSRs, by animal, ranged from 24.0 s to 63.6 s and animals tended to maintain a consistent BSR heading during long BSR series encompassing multiple dives. BSRs were most frequent between 2200 and 0400. We identify three classes of behavior: simple side-roll, side-roll inversion, and repetitive scooping. Results indicate that BSR feeding is a common technique in the study area and there is both coordination and noncoordination between animals. We argue that this behavior is not lunge feeding as normally characterized, because animals are moving slowly through the event.

As optimality arguments are often a priori and always speculative, the critics point out that there is no theoretical basis for any maximization principles in biology. They contend that only empirical work can establish if there are some properties of species that are generally maximized by natural selection. I accept this standard for evaluation, and argue that the concept of surplus power, which provides a physiological basis for optimal foraging and life history theory, is related to fitness. Evidence in the form of specific morphological and behavioral traits in teleost fishes is presented to demonstrate that natural selection has increased surplus power. Life history theory is concerned with how power is allocated by organisms to various vital functions; therefore, the specific problem of stock and recruitment in fisheries can be treated as a special application of life history theory.

  {"id":"wasser_etal17","abstract":"The Southern Resident killer whale population (Orcinus orca) was listed as endangered in 2005 and shows little sign of recovery. These fish eating whales feed primarily on endangered Chinook salmon. Population growth is constrained by low offspring production for the number of reproductive females in the population. Lack of prey, increased toxins and vessel disturbance have been listed as potential causes of the whale’s decline, but partitioning these pressures has been difficult. We validated and applied temporal measures of progesterone and testosterone metabolites to assess occurrence, stage and health of pregnancy from genotyped killer whale feces collected using detection dogs. Thyroid and glucocorticoid hormone metabolites were measured from these same samples to assess physiological stress. These methods enabled us to assess pregnancy occurrence and failure as well as how pregnancy success was temporally impacted by nutritional and other stressors, between 2008 and 2014. Up to 69% of all detectable pregnancies were unsuccessful; of these, up to 33% failed relatively late in gestation or immediately post-partum, when the cost is especially high. Low availability of Chinook salmon appears to be an important stressor among these fish-eating whales as well as a significant cause of late pregnancy failure, including unobserved perinatal loss. However, release of lipophilic toxicants during fat metabolism in the nutritionally deprived animals may also provide a contributor to these cumulative effects. Results point to the importance of promoting Chinook salmon recovery to enhance population growth of Southern Resident killer whales. The physiological measures used in this study can also be used to monitor the success of actions aimed at promoting adaptive management of this important apex predator to the Pacific Northwest.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Wasser","given":"Samuel K."},{"family":"Lundin","given":"Jessica I."},{"family":"Ayres","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Seely","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Giles","given":"Deborah"},{"family":"Balcomb","given":"Kenneth"},{"family":"Hempelmann","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Parsons","given":"Kim"},{"family":"Booth","given":"Rebecca"}],"citation-key":"wasser_etal17","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0179824","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","page":"e0179824","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Population growth is limited by nutritional impacts on pregnancy success in endangered Southern Resident killer whales (Orcinus orca)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0179824","volume":"12"},

Proximate causes of RM endothermy are well understood, but ultimate causes are unclear. Two advantages often proposed are thermal niche expansion and elevated cruising speeds. The thermal niche hypothesis is generally supported, because fishes with RM endothermy often exhibit greater tolerance to broad temperature ranges. In contrast, whether fishes with RM endothermy cruise faster, and achieve any ecological benefits from doing so, remains unclear. Here, we compiled data recorded by modern animal-tracking tools for a variety of free-swimming marine vertebrates. Using phylogenetically informed allometry, we show that both cruising speeds and maximum annual migration ranges of fishes with RM endothermy are 2–3 times greater than fishes without it, and comparable to nonfish endotherms (i.e., penguins and marine mammals). The estimated cost of transport of fishes with RM endothermy is twice that of fishes without it. We suggest that the high energetic cost of RM endothermy in fishes is offset by the benefit of elevated cruising speeds, which not only increase prey encounter rates, but also enable larger-scale annual migrations and potentially greater access to seasonally available resources.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Watanabe","given":"Yuuki Y."},{"family":"Goldman","given":"Kenneth J."},{"family":"Caselle","given":"Jennifer E."},{"family":"Chapman","given":"Demian D."},{"family":"Papastamatiou","given":"Yannis P."}],"citation-key":"watanabe_etal15","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1500316112","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","page":"6104-6109","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Comparative analyses of animal-tracking data reveal ecological significance of endothermy in fishes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1500316112","volume":"112"},

Quantifying the energetics and activity of the regionally endothermic species will help us understand how a fundamental biophysical process (i.e. temperature-dependent metabolism) shapes animal ecology; however, such information is limited owing to difficulties in studying these large, highly active animals. White sharks, Carcharodon carcharias, are the largest fish with regional endothermy, and potentially among the most energy-demanding fishes. Here, we deployed multi-sensor loggers on eight white sharks aggregating near colonies of long-nosed fur seals, Arctocephalus forsteri, off the Neptune Islands, Australia. Simultaneous measurements of depth, swim speed (a proxy for swimming metabolic rate) and body acceleration (indicating when sharks exhibited energy-efficient gliding behaviour) revealed their fine-scale swimming behaviour and allowed us to estimate their energy expenditure. Sharks repeatedly dived (mean swimming depth, 29 m) and swam at the surface between deep dives (maximum depth, 108 m). Modal swim speeds (0.80–1.35 m s−1) were slower than the estimated speeds that minimize cost of transport (1.3–1.9 m s−1), a pattern analogous to a ‘sit-and-wait’ strategy for a perpetually swimming species. All but one shark employed unpowered gliding during descents, rendering deep (>50 m) dives 29% less costly than surface swimming, which may incur additional wave drag. We suggest that these behavioural strategies may help sharks to maximize net energy gains by reducing swimming cost while increasing encounter rates with fast-swimming seals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Watanabe","given":"Yuuki Y."},{"family":"Payne","given":"Nicholas L."},{"family":"Semmens","given":"Jayson M."},{"family":"Fox","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Huveneers","given":"Charlie"}],"citation-key":"watanabe_etal19","container-title":"The Journal of Experimental Biology","DOI":"10.1242/jeb.185603","ISSN":"0022-0949, 1477-9145","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"jeb185603","source":"Crossref","title":"Swimming strategies and energetics of endothermic white sharks during foraging","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://jeb.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/jeb.185603","volume":"222"},
  {"id":"watanabe_goldbogen21","abstract":"Wild animals are under selective pressure to optimise energy budgets; therefore, quantifying energy expenditure, intake and allocation to specific activities is important if we are to understand how animals survive in their environment. One approach toward estimating energy budgets has involved measuring oxygen consumption rates under controlled conditions and constructing allometric relationships across species. However, studying 'giant' marine vertebrates (e.g. pelagic sharks, whales) in this way is logistically difficult or impossible. An alternative approach involves the use of increasingly sophisticated electronic tags that have allowed recordings of behaviour, internal states and the surrounding environment of marine animals. This Review outlines how we could study the energy expenditure and intake of free-living ocean giants using this 'biologging' technology. There are kinematic, physiological and theoretical approaches for estimating energy expenditure, each of which has merits and limitations. Importantly, tag-derived energy proxies can hardly be validated against oxygen consumption rates for giant species. The proxies are thus qualitative, rather than quantitative, estimates of energy expenditure, and have more limited utilities. Despite this limitation, these proxies allow us to study the energetics of ocean giants in their behavioural context, providing insight into how these animals optimise their energy budgets under natural conditions. We also outline how information on energy intake and foraging behaviour can be gained from tag data.

This difficulty is being overcome by biologging and biotelemetry, or the use of miniaturized animal-borne sensors. Although early studies recorded only simple parameters of animal movement, advanced devices and analytical methods can now provide rich information on individual and group behavior, internal states, and the surrounding environment of free-ranging animals, especially those in marine systems. We summarize the history of technologies used to track marine animals. We then identify seven major research categories of marine biologging and biotelemetry and explain significant achievements, as well as future opportunities.

  {"id":"webb_debuffrenil90","abstract":"As aquatic vertebrates increase in size, hydrofoils, which use lift to generate thrust, are increasingly used as propulsors. One factor affecting the magnitude of the lift force is the area of the propulsor. Resistance to cruising and sprints is mainly due to drag, but inertia is important during maneuvers when animals accelerate or turn. The inertia of the body and entrained water, which is proportional to body volume, resists acceleration. Because a thrust that is proportional to surface area is used to maneuver a resistance that is proportional to volume, acceleration performance and maneuverability are expected to decline with increasing size. This trend is ameliorated to some extent by the high swimming speeds attainable by warm-bodied vertebrates and the reduced resistance to acceleration characteristic of the skeletons of dolphins and ichthyosaurs. Maneuvers are essential for capture of elusive prey and avoidance of predators. As they increase in size, aquatic vertebrates use various means to ensure that their prey are less maneuverable than they. These include consumption of increasingly smaller prey relative to predator body size (culminating in filter feeding by the largest aquatic vertebrates); behaviors to concentrate, disturb, and disorient prey; and ambushing or suction feeding that avoid whole-body acceleration. Advantages of warm muscles are seen in the ability of endotherms to take more maneuverable prey than can ectotherms of the same size. Youngstages of large aquatic vertebrates could be especially vulnerable to predators; viviparity or spawning in productive patches provides for rapid growth through vulnerable stages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Webb","given":"Paul W."},{"family":"De Buffrénil","given":"Vivian"}],"citation-key":"webb_debuffrenil90","container-title":"Transactions of the American Fisheries Society","DOI":"10.1577/1548-8659(1990)119<0629:LITBOL>2.3.CO;2","ISSN":"0002-8487, 1548-8659","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1990]]},"language":"en","page":"629-641","source":"Crossref","title":"Locomotion in the Biology of Large Aquatic Vertebrates","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1577/1548-8659(1990)119<0629:LITBOL>2.3.CO;2","volume":"119"},

  {"id":"weber09","abstract":"Long-distance migrants have evolved specific adaptations that make their athletic records possible. Unique mechanisms explaining their amazing capacity for endurance exercise have now been uncovered, particularly with respect to energy storage, mobilization, transport and utilization. Birds are champions of migration because flying offers a key compromise: it allows more rapid movement than swimming, but has a lower cost of transport than running. High efficiency for muscle contraction, pointed wings, low wingloading, travelling in V-formations, storing fuel as energy-dense lipids and atrophy of non-essential organs are some of their strategies to decrease the cost of transport. The ability to process lipids rapidly also emerges as a crucial component of the migrant phenotype. High lipid fluxes are made possible by lipoprotein shuttles and fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) that accelerate lipid transport and by upgrading the metabolic machinery for lipolysis and lipid oxidation. Preparation for long flights can include natural doping on n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) from unique invertebrate diets. Muscle performance is improved by restructuring membrane phospholipids and by activating key genes of lipid metabolism through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). The physiological secret to long migrations does not depend on a single `magic' adaptation but on the integration of multiple adjustments in morphology, biomechanics, behavior,nutrition and metabolism. Research on the physiology of migrants improves the fundamental knowledge of exercise biology, but it also has important implications for wildlife conservation, treating obesity and improving the performance of human athletes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Weber","given":"Jean-Michel"}],"citation-key":"weber09","container-title":"Journal of Experimental Biology","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Biology","DOI":"10.1242/jeb.015024","ISSN":"0022-0949","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"page":"593-597","source":"Silverchair","title":"The physiology of long-distance migration: extending the limits of endurance metabolism","title-short":"The physiology of long-distance migration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.015024","volume":"212"},

  {"id":"weinstein_etal18","abstract":"Matching animal movement with the behaviors that shape life history requires a rigorous connection between the observed patterns of space use and inferred behavioral states. As animal-borne dataloggers capture a greater diversity and frequency of three dimensional movements, we can increase the complexity of movement models describing animal behavior. One challenge in combining data streams is the different spatial and temporal frequency of observations. Nested movement models provide a flexible framework for gleaning data from long-duration, but temporally sparse, data sources. Using a two-layer nested model, we combined geographic and vertical movement to infer traveling, foraging and resting behaviors of Humpback whales off the West Antarctic Peninsula. This approach refined previous work using only geographic data to delineate coarser behavioral states. Our results showed increased intensity in foraging activity in late season animals as the whales prepared to migrate north to tropical calving grounds. Our model also suggests strong diel variation in movement states, likely linked to daily changes in prey distribution. Using a combination of two-dimensional and three-dimensional movement data, we highlight the connection between whale movement and krill availability, as well as the complex spatial pattern of whale foraging in productive polar waters.","author":[{"family":"Weinstein","given":"Ben G."},{"family":"Irvine","given":"Ladd M."},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari S."}],"citation-key":"weinstein_etal18","container-title":"Movement ecology","DOI":"10.1186/s40462-018-0134-4","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,20]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2887263104","page":"16-16","title":"Capturing foraging and resting behavior using nested multivariate Markov models in an air-breathing marine vertebrate","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"wensveen_etal15","abstract":"Detailed information about animal location and movement is often crucial in studies of natural behaviour and how animals respond to anthropogenic activities. Dead-reckoning can be used to infer such detailed information, but without additional positional data this method results in uncertainty that grows with time. Combining dead-reckoning with new Fastloc-GPS technology should provide good opportunities for reconstructing georeferenced fine-scale tracks, and should be particularly useful for marine animals that spend most of their time under water. We developed a computationally efficient, Bayesian state-space modelling technique to estimate humpback whale locations through time, integrating dead-reckoning using on-animal sensors with measurements of whale locations using on-animal Fastloc-GPS and visual observations. Positional observation models were based upon error measurements made during calibrations. High-resolution 3-dimensional movement tracks were produced for 13 whales using a simple process model in which errors caused by water current movements,non-location sensor errors, and other dead-reckoning errors were accumulated into a combined error term. Positional uncertainty quantified by the track reconstruction model was much greater for tracks with visual positions and few or no GPS positions, indicating a strong benefit to using Fastloc-GPS for track reconstruction. Compared to tracks derived only from position fixes, the inclusion of dead-reckoning data greatly improved the level of detail in the reconstructed tracks of humpback whales. Using cross-validation, a clear improvement in the predictability of out-of-set Fastloc-GPS data was observed compared to more conventional track reconstruction methods.Fastloc-GPS observation errors during calibrations were found to vary by number of GPS satellites received and by orthogonal dimension analysed; visual observation errors varied most by distance to the whale. By systematically accounting for the observation errors in the position fixes, our model provides a quantitative estimate of location uncertainty that can be appropriately incorporated into analyses of animal movement. This generic method has potential application for a wide range of marine animal species and data recording systems.","author":[{"family":"Wensveen","given":"Paul J."},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Len"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Patrick J.

  {"id":"wensveen_etal17","abstract":"Exposure to underwater sound can cause permanent hearing loss and other physiological effects in marine animals. To reduce this risk, naval sonars are sometimes gradually increased in intensity at the start of transmission ('ramp-up'). Here, we conducted experiments in which tagged humpback whales were approached with a ship to test whether a sonar operation preceded by ramp-up reduced three risk indicators - maximum sound pressure level (SPLmax), cumulative sound exposure level (SELcum) and minimum source-whale range (Rmin) - compared with a sonar operation not preceded by ramp-up. Whales were subject to one no-sonar control session and either two successive ramp-up sessions (RampUp1, RampUp2) or a ramp-up session (RampUp1) and a full-power session (FullPower). Full-power sessions were conducted only twice; for other whales we used acoustic modelling that assumed transmission of the full-power sequence during their no-sonar control. Averaged overall whales, risk indicators in RampUp1 (n=11) differed significantly from those in FullPower (n=12) by -3.0 dB (SPLmax), -2.0 dB (SELcum) and +168 m (Rmin), but not significantly from those in RampUp2 (n=9). Only five whales in RampUp1, four whales in RampUp2 and none in FullPower or control sessions avoided the sound source. For RampUp1, we found statistically significant differences in risk indicators between whales that avoided the sonar and whales that did not: -4.7 dB (SPLmax), -3.4 dB (SELcum) and +291 m (Rmin). In contrast, for RampUp2, these differences were smaller and not significant. This study suggests that sonar ramp-up has a positive but limited mitigative effect for humpback whales overall, but that ramp-up can reduce the risk of harm more effectively in situations when animals are more responsive and likely to avoid the sonar, e.g. owing to novelty of the stimulus, when they are in the path of an approaching sonar ship. © 2017.

We present evidence that this size selection is related to the optimal allocation of time spent searching for, and handling prey. A model relating search and handling time to energy return is constructed to determine the optimal breadth of diet. Prey are permitted to differ in size and relative abundance. All elements of the model are estimated from experiments with the bluegill feeding on populations constructed from size classes of Daphnia magna. Relative visibility of the different prey sizes markedly affects relative encounter rates or 'effective' proportions. Effective proportions are determined empirically from feeding experiments and theoretically from reaction distance in order to correct for this bias. Search time is then manipulated by varying absolute abundance of prey. At low absolute abundance, prey of different size are eaten as encountered. As prey abundance is increased, size classes are dropped sequentially from the diet in accordance with the theory. Search and handling times are estimated from these experiments and quantitative comparisons with the model indicate these changes in diet maximize return with respect to time spent foraging.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Werner","given":"Earl E."},{"family":"Hall","given":"Donald J."}],"citation-key":"werner_hall74","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.2307/1940354","ISSN":"1939-9170","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[1974]]},"language":"en","page":"1042-1052","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Optimal Foraging and the Size Selection of Prey by the Bluegill Sunfish (Lepomis Macrochirus)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2307/1940354","volume":"55"},
  {"id":"werth_crompton23","abstract":"Cetaceans are atypical mammals whose tongues often depart from the typical (basal) mammalian condition in structure, mobility, and function. Their tongues are dynamic, innovative multipurpose tools that include the world's largest muscular structures. These changes reflect the evolutionary history of cetaceans' secondary adaptation to a fully aquatic environment. Cetacean tongues play no role in mastication and apparently a greatly reduced role in nursing (mainly channeling milk ingestion), two hallmarks of Mammalia. Cetacean tongues are not involved in drinking, breathing, vocalizing, and other non-feeding activities; they evidently play no or little role in taste reception. Although cetaceans do not masticate or otherwise process food, their tongues retain key roles in food ingestion, transport, securing/positioning, and swallowing, though by different means than most mammals. This is due to cetaceans' aquatic habitat, which in turn altered their anatomy (e.g., the intranarial larynx and consequent soft palate alteration). Odontocetes ingest prey via raptorial biting or tongue-generated suction. Odontocete tongues expel water and possibly uncover benthic prey via hydraulic jetting. Mysticete tongues play crucial roles driving ram, suction, or lunge ingestion for filter feeding. The uniquely flaccid rorqual tongue, not a constant volume hydrostat (as in all other mammalian tongues), invaginates into a balloon-like pouch to temporarily hold engulfed water. Mysticete tongues also create hydrodynamic flow regimes and hydraulic forces for baleen filtration, and possibly for cleaning baleen. Cetacean tongues lost or modified much of the mobility and function of generic mammal tongues, but took on noteworthy morphological changes by evolving to accomplish new tasks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Werth","given":"Alexander J."},{"family":"Crompton","given":"A.

Although humpback feeding is famous for its flexibility, several stereotyped events were noted in the 47 lunges we analyzed. Engulfment was rapid (mean 2.07 s), and the entrance through which the tongue inverts into the ventral pouch was seen as water rushes in. Cranial elevation was a major contributor to gape, and pouch contraction sometimes began before full gape closure, with reverberating waves indicating rebounding flow of water within the expanded pouch. Expulsion of filtered water began with a small splash at the anterior of the mouth, followed by sustained excurrent flow in the mouth's central or posterior regions. Apart from a splash of rebounding water, water within the mouth was surprisingly turbulence-free during engulfment, but submersion of the whale's head created visible surface whirlpools and vortices which may aggregate prey for subsequent engulfment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Werth","given":"Alexander J."},{"family":"Kosma","given":"Madison M."},{"family":"Chenoweth","given":"Ellen M."},{"family":"Straley","given":"Janice M."}],"citation-key":"werth_etal19","container-title":"Marine Mammal Science","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/mms.12614","ISSN":"1748-7692","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"1556-1578","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"New views of humpback whale flow dynamics and oral morphology during prey engulfment","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mms.12614","volume":"35"},

A mathematical model was created to test and quantify water flow predictions with steady state hydromechanical equations; a physical model of the bowhead mouth(approximately 1/15 scale) was constructed to visualize flow processes. Both models rely on morphometric data obtained from whales harvested by Inupiat Eskimos for subsistence purposes along with information on foraging ecology(locomotor velocity, gape, etc.). Results indicate that unique features of balaenid oral construction and function (e.g. subrostral gap, orolabial sulcus, curvature of baleen, extensive mandibular rotation and lingual mobility) not only permit steady, unidirectional flow of water through the mouth, but also establish Bernoulli and Venturi effects during feeding.

The number of whales in a group was closely related to the horizontal size of the prey schools on which the whales were feeding. Associations between individual finbacks were generally of short duration. In these respects finback social behaviour was similar to that of the humpback whales that frequently fed on the same prey schools as the finbacks. However, finbacks moved faster than the humpbacks, stayed further apart from conspecifics, and, unlike the humpbacks, were never observed to perform energetic above-water displays. Differences in speed and manoeuvrability between the two species may explain why they rarely formed interspecific groupings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Whitehead","given":"Hal"},{"family":"Carlson","given":"Carole"}],"citation-key":"whitehead_carlson88","container-title":"Canadian Journal of Zoology","container-title-short":"Can.

  {"id":"wiley_etal11","abstract":"Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) employ a unique and complex foraging behaviour — bubble-netting — that involves expelling air underwater to form a vertical cylinder-ring of bubbles around prey. We used digital suction cup tags (DTAGs) that concurrently measure pitch, roll, heading, depth and sound (96 kHz sampling rate), to provide the first depiction of the underwater behaviours in which humpback whales engage during bubble-net feeding. Body mechanics and swim paths were analysed using custom visualization software that animates the underwater track of the whale and quantifies tag sensor values. Bubble production was identified aurally and through spectrographic analysis of tag audio records. We identified two classes of behaviour (upward-spiral; 6 animals, 118 events and double-loop; 3 animals, 182 events) that whales used to create bubble nets. Specifically, we show the actual swim path of the whales (e.g., number of revolutions, turning rate, depth interval of spiral), when and where in the process bubbles were expelled and the pattern of bubble expulsion used by the animals. Relative to other baleanopterids, bubble-netting humpbacks demonstrate increased manoeuvrability probably aided by a unique hydrodynamicly enhanced body form. We identified an approximately 20 m depth or depth interval limit to the use of bubble nets and suggest that this limit is due to the physics of bubble dispersal to which humpback whales have behaviourally adapted. All animals were feeding with at least one untagged animal and we use our data to speculate that reciprocity or by-product mutualism best explain coordinated feeding behaviour in humpbacks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Wiley","given":"David"},{"family":"Ware","given":"Colin"},{"family":"Bocconcelli","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Cholewiak","given":"Danielle"},{"family":"Friedlaender","given":"Ari"},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Weinrich","given":"Mason"}],"citation-key":"wiley_etal11","container-title":"Behaviour","ISSN":"0005-7959","issue":"5/6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"page":"575-602","publisher":"BRILL","source":"JSTOR","title":"Underwater components of humpback whale bubble-net feeding behaviour","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23034261","volume":"148"},

Evidence for density-dependent changes in body condition and pregnancy rate of North Atlantic fin whales over four decades of varying environmental conditions. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 70: 1273–1280.A central theme in ecology is the search for pattern in the response of a species to changing environmental conditions. Natural resource management and endangered species conservation require an understanding of density-dependent and density-independent factors that regulate populations. Marine mammal populations are expected to express density dependence in the same way as terrestrial mammals, but logistical difficulties in data acquisition for many large whale species have hindered attempts to identify population-regulation mechanisms. We explored relationships between body condition (inferred from patterns in blubber thickness) and per capita prey abundance, and between pregnancy rate and body condition in North Atlantic fin whales as environmental conditions and population size varied between 1967 and 2010. Blubber thickness in both males and females declined at low per capita prey availability, and in breeding-age females, pregnancy rate declined at low blubber thickness, demonstrating a density-dependent response of pregnancy to prey limitation mediated through body condition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a quantitative relationship among per capita prey abundance, body condition, and pregnancy rate has been documented for whales. As long-lived predators, marine mammals can act as indicators of the state of marine ecosystems. Improving our understanding of the relationships that link prey, body condition, and population parameters such as pregnancy rate and survival will become increasingly useful as these systems are affected by natural and anthropogenic change. Quantifying linkages among prey, fitness and vital rates will improve our ability to predict population consequences of subtle, sublethal impacts of ocean noise and other anthropogenic stressors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Rob"},{"family":"Vikingsson","given":"Gisli A."},{"family":"Gislason","given":"Astthor"},{"family":"Lockyer","given":"Christina"},{"family":"New","given":"Leslie"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Len"},{"family":"Hammond","given":"Philip S."}],"citation-key":"williams_etal13","container-title":"ICES Journal of Marine Science","container-title-short":"ICES Journal of Marine Science","DOI":"10.1093/icesjms/fst059","ISSN":"1054-3139","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"page":"1273-1280","source":"Silverchair","title":"Evidence for density-dependent changes in body condition and pregnancy rate of North Atlantic fin whales over four decades of varying environmental conditions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fst059","volume":"70"},

  {"id":"williams_etal17a","abstract":"Exponential increases in hydrodynamic drag and physical exertion occur when swimmers move quickly through water, and underlie the preference for relatively slow routine speeds by marine mammals regardless of body size. Because of this and the need to balance limited oxygen stores when submerged, flight (escape) responses may be especially challenging for this group. To examine this, we used open-flow respirometry to measure the energetic cost of producing a swimming stroke during different levels of exercise in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). These data were then used to model the energetic cost of high-speed escape responses by other odontocetes ranging in mass from 42 to 2738 kg. The total cost per stroke during routine swimming by dolphins, 3.31± 0.20 J kg−1 stroke−1, was doubled during maximal aerobic performance. A comparative analysis of locomotor costs (LC; in J kg−1 stroke−1), representing the cost of moving the flukes, revealed that LC during routine swimming increased with body mass (M ) for odontocetes according to LC=1.46±0.0005M; a separate relationship described LC during high-speed stroking. Using these relationships, we found that continuous stroking coupled with reduced glide time in response to oceanic noise resulted in a 30.5% increase in metabolic rate in the beaked whale, a deep-diving odontocete considered especially sensitive to disturbance. By integrating energetics with swimming behavior and dive characteristics, this study demonstrates the physiological consequences of oceanic noise on diving mammals, and provides a powerful tool for predicting the biological significance of escape responses by cetaceans facing anthropogenic disturbances.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Terrie M."},{"family":"Kendall","given":"Traci L."},{"family":"Richter","given":"Beau P."},{"family":"Ribeiro-French","given":"Courtney R."},{"family":"John","given":"Jason S."},{"family":"Odell","given":"Kim L."},{"family":"Losch","given":"Barbara A."},{"family":"Feuerbach","given":"David A."},{"family":"Stamper","given":"M.

  {"id":"williams_etal20","abstract":"The paradigm-changing opportunities of biologging sensors for ecological research, especially movement ecology, are vast, but the crucial questions of how best to match the most appropriate sensors and sensor combinations to specific biological questions and how to analyse complex biologging data, are mostly ignored. Here, we fill this gap by reviewing how to optimize the use of biologging techniques to answer questions in movement ecology and synthesize this into an Integrated Biologging Framework (IBF). We highlight that multisensor approaches are a new frontier in biologging, while identifying current limitations and avenues for future development in sensor technology. We focus on the importance of efficient data exploration, and more advanced multidimensional visualization methods, combined with appropriate archiving and sharing approaches, to tackle the big data issues presented by biologging. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities in matching the peculiarities of specific sensor data to the statistical models used, highlighting at the same time the large advances which will be required in the latter to properly analyse biologging data. Taking advantage of the biologging revolution will require a large improvement in the theoretical and mathematical foundations of movement ecology, to include the rich set of high-frequency multivariate data, which greatly expand the fundamentally limited and coarse data that could be collected using location-only technology such as GPS. Equally important will be the establishment of multidisciplinary collaborations to catalyse the opportunities offered by current and future biologging technology.

  {"id":"williams_etal93","abstract":"Despite speculation about the swimming efficiency of cetaceans, few studies have investigated the exercise physiology of these mammals. In view of this, we examined the physiological responses and locomotor energetics of two exercising adult Tursiops truncatus. Oxygen consumption, heart rate, respiratory rate and post-exercise blood lactate concentration were determined for animals either pushing against a load cell or swimming next to a boat. Many of the energetic and cardiorespiratory responses of exercising dolphins were similar to those of terrestrial mammals. Average heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen consumption for dolphins pushing against a load cell increased linearly with exercise levels up to 58kg for a female dolphin and 85kg for a male. Oxygen consumption did not increase with higher loads. Maximum rate of oxygen consumption (V˙O∑max) ranged from 19.8 to 29.4 ml O2 kgϪ1 minϪ1, which was 7–11 times the calculated standard metabolic rate (V˙O∑std) of the dolphins. Blood lactate concentration increased with exercise loads that exceeded V˙O∑max. The maximum lactate concentration was 101.4 mgdlϪ1 (11.3mmol lϪ1) for the male, and 120.6 mgdlϪ1 (13.6mmol lϪ1) for the female. When swimming at 2.1msϪ1, heart rate, respiratory rate and post-exercise blood lactate concentration of the dolphins were not signiﬁcantly different from values at rest. The cost of transport at this speed was 1.29±0.05J kgϪ1 minϪ1.

  {"id":"williams_noren09","abstract":"The physiology of free-ranging cetaceans is difﬁcult to study and as a consequence, data on the energetics of these animals are limited. To better understand the energetic cost of swimming in killer whales, total cost of transport (COT) was estimated from swimming speeds and respiration rates from wild adult northern resident killer whales (Orcinus orca) and reported values of oxygen consumption in captive whales. Respiration rate (breaths per minute) was positively correlated with swimming speed (meters per second), while mass-speciﬁc COT (Joules per kilogram per meter) decreased with speed. Lack of data on very fast-swimming animals hindered assessment of the exact speed at which COT was minimal. However, minimum mass-speciﬁc COT for killer whales in the present study approached those predicted by a previously published allometric equation for marine mammals, and corresponded to “optimal” swimming speeds of 2.6–3 m/s. Interestingly, the observed average swimming speed (1.6 m/s) was lower than predicted optimal swimming speed. Finally, females with dependent calves had higher respiration rates than females without calves. These ﬁndings could be due to synchronous breathing with calves or could result from increased costs of lactation and swimming with a calf in echelon formation.

  {"id":"williams04","abstract":"Summary Foraging by mammals is a complex suite of behaviors that can entail high energetic costs associated with supporting basal metabolism, locomotion and the digestion of prey. To determine the contribution of these various costs in a free-ranging marine mammal, we measured the post-dive oxygen consumption of adult Weddell seals (N=9) performing foraging and nonforaging dives from an isolated ice hole in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. Dives were classiﬁed according to behavior as monitored by an attached video-data logging system (recording activity, time, depth, velocity and stroking). We found that recovery oxygen consumption showed a biphasic relationship with dive duration that corresponded to the onset of plasma lactate accumulation at approximately 23·min. Locomotor costs for diving Weddell seals increased linearly with the number of strokes taken according to the relationship: locomotor cost = –3.78+0.04 × stroke number (r2=0.74, N=90 dives), where locomotor cost is in ml·O2·kg–1. Foraging dives in which seals ingested Pleuragramma antarcticum resulted in a 44.7% increase in recovery oxygen consumption compared to non-foraging dives, which we attributed to the digestion and warming of prey. The results show that the energy expended in digestion for a free-ranging marine mammal are additive to locomotor and basal costs. By accounting for each of these costs and monitoring stroking mechanics, it is possible to estimate the aerobic cost of diving in free-ranging seals where cryptic behavior and remote locations prevent direct energetic measurements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"T.

Despite a broad range of body shapes and sizes, most marine mammals maintain a streamlined body profile that facilitates forward movement through water by reducing total body drag. By remaining submerged for prolonged periods, the energetic cost of swimming in marine mammals is lower than reported for animals or humans that remain on the water surface. Behavioral strategies such as porpoising, wave-riding, gliding, and unsteady forms of swimming (i.e., burst and glide propulsion) also add to the energetic efficiency of marine mammal locomotion.

  {"id":"williams22","abstract":"Reinvasion of the oceans beginning 10–60 million years ago by ancient mammals instigated one of the most remarkable metabolic transitions across evolutionary time. A consequence of marine living, especially in colder waters, has been a 1.4 to 2.9-fold increase in resting metabolic rate (RMR) for otters, pinnipeds and cetaceans over predicted levels for terrestrial mammals of similar body mass. Notably, the greatest metabolic elevation occurred in the smallest marine mammals, suggesting an underlying thermal causative mechanism. Superimposed on these resting costs are the metabolic demands of locomotion. Collectively termed the field metabolic rate, such active costs consistently approach three times the resting rates of individuals regardless of locomotor style, species, foraging patterns, habitat or geographic location. In wild non-reproducing mammals, the FMR/RMR ratio averages 2.6–2.8 for both terrestrial and marine species, with the latter group maintaining larger absolute daily metabolic rates supported by comparatively higher food ingestion rates. Interestingly, the limit for habitual (multi-day), sustained maximal energy expenditure in human endurance athletes averages &lt; 3.0 times resting metabolic levels, with a notable exception in Tour de France cyclists. Importantly, both athletes and wild mammals seem similarly constrained; that is, by the ability to process enough calories in a day to support exceptional metabolic performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Terrie M"}],"citation-key":"williams22","container-title":"Integrative and Comparative Biology","container-title-short":"Integrative and Comparative Biology","DOI":"10.1093/icb/icac054","ISSN":"1540-7063","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"page":"icac054","source":"Silverchair","title":"Racing Time: Physiological Rates and Metabolic Scaling in Marine Mammals","title-short":"Racing Time","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/icac054"},

  {"id":"wilson_etal06","abstract":"1 Time and energy are key currencies in animal ecology, and judicious management of these is a primary focus for natural selection. At present, however, there are only two main methods for estimation of rate of energy expenditure in the field, heart rate and doubly labelled water, both of which have been used with success; but both also have their limitations. 2 The deployment of data loggers that measure acceleration is emerging as a powerful tool for quantifying the behaviour of free-living animals. Given that animal movement requires the use of energy, the accelerometry technique potentially has application in the quantification of rate of energy expenditure during activity. 3 In the present study, we test the hypothesis that acceleration can serve as a proxy for rate of energy expenditure in free-living animals. We measured rate of energy expenditure as rates of O2 consumption () and CO2 production () in great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) at rest and during pedestrian exercise. and were then related to overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) measured with an externally attached three-axis accelerometer. 4 Both and were significantly positively associated with ODBA in great cormorants. This suggests that accelerometric measurements of ODBA can be used to estimate and and, with some additional assumptions regarding metabolic substrate use and the energy equivalence of O2 and CO2, that ODBA can be used to estimate the activity specific rate of energy expenditure of free-living cormorants. 5 To verify that the approach identifies expected trends in from situations with variable power requirements, we measured ODBA in free-living imperial cormorants (Phalacrocorax atriceps) during foraging trips. We compared ODBA during return and outward foraging flights, when birds are expected to be laden and not laden with captured fish, respectively. We also examined changes in ODBA during the descent phase of diving, when power requirements are predicted to decrease with depth due to changes in buoyancy associated with compression of plumage and respiratory air. 6 In free-living imperial cormorants, ODBA, and hence estimated , was higher during the return flight of a foraging bout, and decreased with depth during the descent phase of a dive, supporting the use of accelerometry for the determination of activity-specific rate of energy expenditure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilson","given":"Rory P."},{"family":"White","given":"Craig R."},{"family":"Quintana","given":"Flavio"},{"family":"Halsey","given":"Lewis G."},{"family":"Liebsch","given":"Nikolai"},{"family":"Martin","given":"Graham R."},{"family":"Butler","given":"Patrick J."}],"citation-key":"wilson_etal06","container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2656.2006.01127.x","ISSN":"1365-2656","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"language":"en","page":"1081-1090","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Moving towards acceleration for estimates of activity-specific metabolic rate in free-living animals: the case of the cormorant","title-short":"Moving towards acceleration for estimates of activity-specific metabolic rate in free-living animals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2006.01127.x","volume":"75"},
  {"id":"wilson_etal07","abstract":"Bar-tailed Godwits (Limosa lapponica) are long-distance migratory shorebirds. About a third of the global population migrate to Australia during the non-breeding season where they occur mainly in the north-west and east. Using measurements of bill, wing, tarsus and total-head ( head and bill), we show that birds from the two main Australian non-breeding regions belong to separate populations. Individuals in north-western Australia are subspecies L. l. menzbieri, which breeds in north-eastern Russia, whereas those in south-eastern Australia are subspecies L. l. baueri, which breeds in northern and western Alaska. Resightings and recoveries of marked birds showed that there is little exchange between the two populations on the non-breeding grounds. They also take different routes during northward migration: L. l. menzbieri was more frequent on staging areas in the western Yellow Sea and largely absent from Japan, whereas L. l. baueri was more numerous in the eastern Yellow Sea and was often recorded in Japan. L. l. baueri left on northward migration 1-2 weeks earlier than L. l. menzbieri and gained more body mass before departure, presumably in preparation for a longer migratory leg. Our data suggest that on northward migration, L. l. menzbieri and L. l. baueri make direct flights of 5400-6200 km and 8200-8500 km, respectively, to reach staging areas in East Asia. The route of Limosa l. menzbieri on its southern passage is similar to that of northward migration, with stop-overs in East Asia. Limosa l. baueri, however, make an similar to 10400-km nonstop flight across the Pacific Ocean from Alaska to eastern Australia, one of the longest non-stop migratory flights known amongst birds.","author":[{"family":"Wilson","given":"Jim"},{"family":"Nebel","given":"Silke"},{"family":"Minton","given":"C.D.T."}],"citation-key":"wilson_etal07","container-title":"Emu","container-title-short":"Emu","DOI":"10.1071/MU07026","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"page":"262-274","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Migration ecology and morphometrics of two Bar-tailed Godwit populations in Australia","type":"article-journal","volume":"107"},

  {"id":"wilson_etal16","abstract":"Rugose projections on the anterior and posterior aspects of vertebral neural spines appear throughout Amniota and result from the mineralization of the supraspinous and interspinous ligaments via metaplasia, the process of permanent tissue-type transformation. In mammals, this metaplasia is generally pathological or stress induced, but is a normal part of development in some clades of birds. Such structures, though phylogenetically sporadic, appear throughout the fossil record of non-avian theropod dinosaurs, yet their physiological and adaptive significance has remained unexamined. Here we show novel histologic and phylogenetic evidence that neural spine projections were a physiological response to biomechanical stress in large-bodied theropod species. Metaplastic projections also appear to vary between immature and mature individuals of the same species, with immature animals either lacking them or exhibiting smaller projections, supporting the hypothesis that these structures develop through ontogeny as a result of increasing bending stress subjected to the spinal column. Metaplastic mineralization of spinal ligaments would likely affect the flexibility of the spinal column, increasing passive support for body weight. A stiff spinal column would also provide biomechanical support for the primary hip flexors and, therefore, may have played a role in locomotor efficiency and mobility in large-bodied species. This new association of interspinal ligament metaplasia in Theropoda with large body size contributes additional insight to our understanding of the diverse biomechanical coping mechanisms developed throughout Dinosauria, and stresses the significance of phylogenetic methods when testing for biological trends, evolutionary or not.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilson","given":"John P."},{"family":"Woodruff","given":"D.

  {"id":"wilson_etal20","abstract":"It is fundamentally important for many animal ecologists to quantify the costs of animal activities, although it is not straightforward to do so. The recording of triaxial acceleration by animal-attached devices has been proposed as a way forward for this, with the specific suggestion that dynamic body acceleration (DBA) be used as a proxy for movement-based power. Dynamic body acceleration has now been validated frequently, both in the laboratory and in the field, although the literature still shows that some aspects of DBA theory and practice are misunderstood. Here, we examine the theory behind DBA and employ modelling approaches to assess factors that affect the link between DBA and energy expenditure, from the deployment of the tag, through to the calibration of DBA with energy use in laboratory and field settings. Using data from a range of species and movement modes, we illustrate that vectorial and additive DBA metrics are proportional to each other. Either can be used as a proxy for energy and summed to estimate total energy expended over a given period, or divided by time to give a proxy for movement-related metabolic power. Nonetheless, we highlight how the ability of DBA to predict metabolic rate declines as the contribution of non-movement-related factors, such as heat production, increases. Overall, DBA seems to be a substantive proxy for movement-based power but consideration of other movement-related metrics, such as the static body acceleration and the rate of change of body pitch and roll, may enable researchers to refine movement-based metabolic costs, particularly in animals where movement is not characterized by marked changes in body acceleration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilson","given":"Rory P."},{"family":"Börger","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Holton","given":"Mark D."},{"family":"Scantlebury","given":"D.

Recorded dives were grouped through visual assessment and t-tests. Dives that indicated likely foraging occurred at a mean maximum depth of 106.2 m with 62% of dives occurring between 92 m and 120 m. Acoustic backscatter from fish surveys was attributed to potential humpback prey based on known target strength values and 10 net tows. Capelin comprised 84% of the total potential prey abundance in the region followed by age 0 (12%) and juvenile pollock (2%), and eulachon (<1%). Although horizontally segregated in the region, both capelin and age 0 pollock were distributed at depths exceeding 92 m with maximum abundance between 107 m and 120 m. The four-tagged humpbacks were found to forage in areas with greatest capelin densities but bypassed areas of high age 0 pollock abundance.

  {"id":"yuakiyama_etal19","abstract":"Central place foraging theory (CPF) has been used to predict the optimal patch residence time for air-breathing marine predators in response to patch quality. Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) forage on densely aggregated prey, which may induce drastic change in prey density in a single feeding event. Thus, the decision whether to leave or stay after each feeding event in a single dive in response to this drastic change, should have a significant effect on prey exploitation efficiency. However, whether humpback whales show adaptive behavior in response to the diminishing prey density in a single dive has been technically difficult to test. Here, we studied the foraging behavior of humpback whales in response to change in prey density in a single dive and calculated the efficiency of each foraging dive using a model based on CPF approach. Using animal-borne accelerometers and video loggers attached to whales, foraging behavior and change in relative prey density in front of the whales were successfully quantified. Results showed diminishing rate of energy intake in consecutive feeding events, and humpback whales efficiently fed by bringing the rate of energy intake close to maximum in a single dive cycle. This video-based method also enabled us to detect the presence of other animals around the tagged whales, showing an interesting trend in behavioral changes where feeding duration was shorter when other animals were present. Our results have introduced a new potential to quantitatively investigate the effect of other animals on free-ranging top predators in the context of optimal foraging theory.","author":[{"literal":"Yu Akiyama"},{"family":"Akiyama","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Akamatsu","given":"Tomonari"},{"family":"Rasmussen","given":"Marianne H."},{"family":"Iversen","given":"Maria R."},{"family":"Iwata","given":"Takashi"},{"family":"Goto","given":"Yusuke"},{"family":"Aoki","given":"Kagari"},{"family":"Sato","given":"Koji"},{"family":"Sato","given":"Katsufumi"},{"family":"Sato","given":"Katsutoshi"}],"citation-key":"yuakiyama_etal19","container-title":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0211138","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,5]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2911924762","PMID":"30721236","title":"Leave or Stay?

  {"id":"zerbini_etal06","abstract":"Southern Hemisphere humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae migrate from wintering grounds in tropical latitudes to feeding areas in the Antarctic Ocean. It has been hypothesized that the population wintering off eastern South America migrates to feeding grounds near the Antarctic Peninsula (ca. 65°S, 60°W) and/or South Georgia (54°20’S, 36°40’W), but direct evidence to support this has never been presented. Between 19 and 28 October 2003, 11 humpback whales (7 females and 4 males) were instrumented with satellite transmitters off Brazil (ca. 18°30’S, 39°30’W) to investigate their movements and migratory destinations. Mean tracking time for the whales was 39.6 d (range = 5 to 205 d) and mean distance travelled was 1673 km per whale (range = 60 to 7258km). Movements on the wintering ground showed marked individual variation. Departure dates from the Brazilian coast ranged from late October to late December. Whales migrated south through oceanic waters at an average heading of 170° and travelled a relatively direct, linear path from wintering to feeding grounds. Two whales were tracked to feeding grounds in offshore areas near South Georgia and in the South Sandwich Islands (58°S, 26°W) after a 40 to 60 d long migration. Historical catches and current sighting information support these migratory routes and destinations. This study is the first to describe the movements of humpback whales in the western South Atlantic Ocean.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Zerbini","given":"Alexandre N."},{"family":"Andriolo","given":"Artur"},{"family":"Heide-Jørgensen","given":"Mads Peter"},{"family":"Pizzorno","given":"José Luis"},{"family":"Maia","given":"Ygor G."},{"family":"VanBlaricom","given":"Glenn R."},{"family":"DeMaster","given":"Douglas P."},{"family":"Simões-Lopes","given":"Paulo César"},{"family":"Moreira","given":"Sérgio"},{"family":"Bethlem","given":"Cláudia"}],"citation-key":"zerbini_etal06","container-title":"Marine Ecology Progress Series","DOI":"10.3354/meps313295","ISSN":"0171-8630, 1616-1599","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"language":"en","page":"295-304","source":"www.int-res.com","title":"Satellite-monitored movements of humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v313/p295-304/","volume":"313"},

  {"id":"zhang_etal22","abstract":"Biologging tags are a key enabling tool for investigating cetacean behavior and locomotion in their natural habitat. Identifying and then parameterizing gait from movement sensor data is critical for these investigations, but how best to characterize gait from tag data remains an open question. Further, the location and orientation of a tag on an animal in the field are variable and can change multiple times during a deployment. As a result, the relative orientation of the tag with respect to (wrt) the animal must be determined for analysis. Currently, custom scripts that involve species-specific heuristics tend to be used in the literature. These methods require a level of knowledge and experience that can affect the reliability and repeatability of the analysis. Swimming gait is composed of a sequence of body poses that have a specific spatial pattern, and tag-based measurements of this pattern can be utilized to determine the relative orientation of the tag. This work presents an automated data processing pipeline (and software) that takes advantage of these patterns to 1) Identify relative motion between the tag and animal; 2) Estimate the relative orientation of the tag wrt the animal using a data-driven approach; and 3) Calculate gait parameters that are stable and invariant to animal pose. Validation results from bottlenose dolphin tag data show that the average relative orientation error (tag wrt the body) after processing was within 11 degrees in roll, pitch, and yaw directions. The average precision and recall for detecting instances of relative motion in the dolphin data were 0.87 and 0.89, respectively. Tag data from humpback and beluga whales were then used to demonstrate how the gait analysis can be used to enhance tag-based investigations of movement and behavior. The MATLAB source code and data presented in the paper are publicly available (https://github.com/ding-z/cetacean-pose-gait-analysis.git), along with suggested best practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Ding"},{"family":"Goodbar","given":"Kari"},{"family":"West","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Lesage","given":"Veronique"},{"family":"Parks","given":"Susan E."},{"family":"Wiley","given":"David N."},{"family":"Barton","given":"Kira"},{"family":"Shorter","given":"K.
